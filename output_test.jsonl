Previous SectionNext Section The discovery of antibiotics remains one of the most important scientific advances in human health, but the proportion of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria is increasing, and new resistance patterns continue to emerge.\n\nIn 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a report that characterized the burden of antibiotic resistance; an estimated 2 million antibiotic-resistant illnesses and 23 000 deaths occur each year in the United States [1].\n\nWhereas the threat of antibiotic resistance continues to grow, development of new antibiotics has lagged dangerously behind [2, 3].\n\nMinimizing the impact of antibiotic resistance requires a multifaceted approach that ensures the availability of effective antibiotics and vaccines, access to rapid and reliable diagnostics, implementation of infection prevention strategies, and appropriate antibiotic use.\n\nAntibiotic use is the most important factor contributing to the spread of resistance [4, 5].\n\nPromoting appropriate antibiotic prescribing is an essential strategy to combat antibiotic resistance [6].\n\nStudies have described serious overuse and inappropriate selection of antibiotics and the need for rational antibiotic prescribing practices in virtually every healthcare setting [7\u201310].\n\nThe outpatient setting accounts for >60% of antibiotic expenditures in the United States [11], indicating that outpatient healthcare settings are an important part of the problem.\n\nRecent prescribing data for children suggest that there has been up to a 24% decrease in antibiotic prescribing since the 1990s, yet 58% of all antibiotic prescriptions in the outpatient setting are for respiratory infections that are predominantly viral in etiology [12, 13].\n\nSeveral studies have demonstrated the success of interventions designed to improve antibiotic prescribing in ambulatory settings [14, 15].\n\nCanadian and European studies suggest that patient socioeconomic factors, such as income and education, have an impact on antibiotic prescribing rates, but these factors have not been explored in the United States [16, 17].\n\nIn 2013, we described wide variation in antibiotic prescribing rates by US state using prescribing data from 2010 [18].\n\nThis prompted a more comprehensive analysis of outpatient antibiotic prescribing data to further characterize prescribing rates by geographic location, provider specialty, and patient population and identify where appropriate antibiotic prescribing interventions could have the most impact.\n\nWe analyzed oral antibiotic prescribing data representing all outpatient US antibiotic prescriptions in 2011 to describe outpatient prescribing patterns.\n\nWe explored the relationship between antibiotic prescribing and socioeconomic and population health factors.\n\nThe analyses provide an evidence base to guide future selection of key target populations and geographic locations for appropriate antibiotic prescribing interventions.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section METHODS Systemic, oral antibiotic prescriptions dispensed by US county during 2011 were extracted from the IMS Health Xponent database.\n\nIMS Health captures >70% of all outpatient prescriptions in the United States, reconciles them to wholesale deliveries, and projects to 100% coverage of all prescription activity using a patented projection method based on a comprehensive sample of patient deidentified prescription transactions, collected from pharmacies that report their entire pharmacy business to IMS Health each week.\n\n[19].\n\nThese data represent all outpatient antibiotic prescriptions, across all payers, including community pharmacies and nongovernmental mail service pharmacies.\n\nThe IMS projection method standardizes these data into estimated prescription counts and uses geospatial methods to align the \u201cestimated\u201d prescriptions for the nonsample pharmacies to prescribers with observed prescribing behaviors for the same product in nearby sample pharmacies.\n\nThe method is routinely validated at various levels of granularity by IMS Health statistical and analytic teams.\n\nPrescription counts were summarized by drug category, provider specialty, and patient age and sex, according to the county where the prescriber was located.\n\nAntibiotics were aggregated into categories according to the Uniform System of Classification (https://www.imshealth.com/deployedfiles/ims/Global/Content/Insights/Health%20Services%20Research%20Network/USC_Classiification_Process_2011.pdf), a therapeutic classification system created by IMS Health, as follows: tetracyclines, cephalosporins and related, lincosamides, macrolides, penicillins, quinolones, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, \u03b2-lactams with increased activity, urinary anti-infectives, and others.\n\nProvider specialties were based on American Medical Association self-designated practice specialties and aggregated into 17 specialty groups: family practice, pediatrics, internal medicine, dentistry, nurse practitioner, physician assistants, emergency medicine, dermatology, medical subspecialty, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, urology, otolaryngology, internal medicine/pediatrics, infectious diseases, pediatric subspecialty, and other.\n\nTo estimate provider denominators and providers per capita, the IMS Health Xponent prescription database was used to extract the total number of prescribers in each provider specialty.\n\nPopulation data were obtained from the US Census bridging files by age group, sex, and race for each county.\n\nWe obtained other county-level data from the American Community Survey (per capita income), the Area Resource File (proportion with a 4-year postsecondary education), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (obesity data).\n\nPrescription and provider data were aggregated for each of the approximately 3000 counties in the United States.\n\nThe total number of prescriptions, corresponding to the county of the prescribing provider, and county-level census denominators were used to calculate per-capita (per 1000) prescribing rates by county, state, and US census region (https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/gtc/gtc_census_divreg.html).\n\nFor the age group analyses, persons <20 years of age and those \u226520 years of age were defined as children and adults, respectively.\n\nThe total number of prescriptions was calculated for each provider specialty.\n\nWe conducted an exploratory analysis using logistic regression modeling to examine the relationship between socioeconomic and population health factors (independent variables) and antibiotic prescribing (dependent variable) at the county level.\n\nSpecifically, for the dependent variable, counties were dichotomized as high or low prescribing based on the top quartile and the remaining complement (bottom 3 quartiles), respectively.\n\nCounty-level independent variables were categorized as follows: Prescribers per capita and the proportions of person obese, \u22642 years of age, or black were dichotomized at the median, with counties below the median as the referent.\n\nPer capita income and the proportion with a 4-year college education were evaluated using thirds with the bottom third as the referent.\n\nThe proportion female was categorized using quartiles with the bottom quartile as the referent.\n\nWe decided how to categorize variables (eg, quartiles) based on the distribution of data for each variable.\n\nWe performed separate multivariable modeling for each independent variable (exposure) and the dichotomized dependent variable, treating the other independent variables as potential confounders.\n\nFirst, we performed univariate regression analysis to determine unadjusted odds ratio between the exposure and antibiotic prescribing.\n\nFor the multivariable analysis, we considered a variable a confounder if there was a change of \u226510% in the odds ratio of the exposure variable [20].\n\nUnadjusted and adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were computed using SAS software (version 9.3; SAS Institute).\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section RESULTS Healthcare providers prescribed 262.5 million courses of outpatient antibiotics in 2011, for a prescribing rate of 842 prescriptions per 1000 persons (Table 1).\n\nPenicillins were the most common antibiotic category prescribed, followed closely by macrolides.\n\nThe most commonly prescribed antibiotic agent was azithromycin at a rate just slightly higher than amoxicillin.\n\nView this table: In this window In a new window Table 1.\n\nAntibiotic Prescribing According to Antibiotic Category, Antibiotic Agent, Sex, and Region in 2011 Among children, healthcare providers prescribed 73.7 million courses of antibiotics for a prescribing rate of 889 prescriptions per 1000 persons.\n\nPenicillins were the most commonly prescribed antibiotic category, and amoxicillin was the most commonly prescribed agent (Table 1).\n\nInfants and children \u22642 years of age were prescribed antibiotics at a higher rate than other age groups (1287 prescriptions per 1000 persons aged \u22642 years vs 1018 and 691 prescriptions per 1000 persons aged 3\u20139 or 10\u201319 years, respectively; both P < .001).\n\nAmong adults (patients aged \u226520 years), healthcare providers prescribed 182.7 million courses of antibiotics, for a prescribing rate of 789 prescriptions per 1000 persons.\n\nMacrolides were the most commonly prescribed antibiotic category, and azithromycin was the most commonly prescribed agent.\n\nPersons \u226565 years of age were prescribed antibiotics at the highest rate among adults (1048 prescriptions per 1000 persons aged \u226565 years vs 685 and 790 prescriptions per 1000 persons aged 20\u201339 or 40\u201364 years; both P < .001).\n\nPrescribing was markedly higher for female than for male patients (Table 1), particularly among the \u226520 year old age group (female patients, 990 prescriptions per 1000 persons; male patients, 596 prescriptions per 1000 persons; P < .001).\n\nNumbers of prescriptions varied considerably by provider specialty (Table 2).\n\nAs anticipated, primary care providers prescribed the most courses.\n\nAmong primary care providers, family practitioners prescribed the highest overall number of antibiotic courses, followed by pediatricians and internists.\n\nOf the remaining specialties, dentists prescribed the most courses, representing 10% of all prescriptions.\n\nWhen the number of prescriptions written per provider was assessed within each specialty, dermatologists had the highest prescribing rate per provider (724 prescriptions per provider in 2011; Table 2).\n\nView this table: In this window In a new window Table 2.\n\nAntibiotic Courses Prescribed and Prescriptions Per Provider in 2011, by Provider Specialty When we considered geographic variation in prescribing, overall prescribing rates were consistently highest in the South census region, compared with other regions of the country (Table 1).\n\nAmong US states, Kentucky had the highest overall prescribing rate (1281 prescriptions per 1000 persons) and Alaska had the lowest (348 prescriptions per 1000 persons; P < .001) (Figures 1A\u2013D).\n\nView larger version: In

per 1000 persons) and West (855 per 1000 persons) (both P < .001; Figure 1B).\n\nAmong US states, Louisiana had the highest prescribing rate in this age group (2197 prescriptions per 1000 persons), and Alaska had the lowest (448 prescriptions per 1000 persons; P < .001).\n\nAmong persons \u226565 years of age, the prescribing rate in the South census region was 1160 prescriptions per 1000 persons, compared with 882 prescriptions per 1000 persons in the West, the region with the lowest rate (P < .001; Figure 1D).\n\nKentucky had the highest prescribing rate in this age group (1463 prescriptions per 1000 persons), and Alaska had the lowest (550 prescriptions per 1000 persons; P < .001).\n\nTable 3 shows unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios with corresponding 95% confidence intervals assessing the association between the county-level independent variables and county-level antibiotic prescribing rates.\n\nCounty-level parameters that were significantly associated with county-level prescribing by univariate regression analysis included prescribers per capita, proportion with a 4-year college education, per capita income, proportion obese, proportion \u22642 years of age, proportion female, and proportion black (Table 3).\n\nThe proportions of the population who were obese or black were highest in the South, the census region with the highest prescribing rate.\n\nIn the multivariable models, county-level variables in their highest categories that were independently associated with increased odds of high county-level prescribing included prescribers per capita, proportion obese, proportion \u22642 years of age, and proportion female.\n\nHowever, 4-year college education and per capita income in their highest categories were associated with a decreased odds of high county-level prescribing (Table 3).\n\nView this table: In this window In a new window Table 3.\n\nResults of Univariate and Multivariable Regression Models Testing the Association Between County-Level Characteristics (Independent Variables) and High Antibiotic Prescribing (Dependent Variable)a Previous SectionNext Section DISCUSSION We present a comprehensive description of outpatient antibiotic prescribing in the United States, a critical step in identifying where appropriate use interventions can have the most impact.\n\nThe South census region consistently had the highest prescribing rates across all age groups.\n\nEven among infants and children \u22642 years of age, a group not expected to vary importantly by region regarding the need for antibiotics, some state prescribing rates in the South census region were >3 times higher those in the Northeast and West regions.\n\nStudies of antibiotic prescribing in Europe have also shown great variation in prescribing rates across different European countries, and US rates were among the highest when compared with European countries [21, 22].\n\nThe marked variability in US state prescribing rates is perhaps more challenging to explain, given national antibiotic prescribing policies and treatment guidelines.\n\nData from other studies suggest that inappropriate prescribing is more common in the South.\n\nIn a study of prescribing for adults in ambulatory care, antibiotics were prescribed for respiratory conditions for which they are rarely indicated during 38% of visits in the West compared with 60% of visits in the South [23].\n\nWe hypothesized that variation in health status and access to healthcare may also partially explain the observed geographic variation.\n\nCounties with a high proportion of obese persons and more providers per population were more likely to have high prescribing rates.\n\nFemale sex was also associated with high prescribing; differences in healthcare seeking behavior and the frequency of healthcare encounters and infections may contribute to this observed sex difference [24].\n\nPrevious studies in Canada and Europe identified low education and income as factors associated with high prescribing [16, 17], and we found the same pattern in our study.\n\nFurther studies should thoroughly examine patient social determinants and provider characteristics influencing antibiotic prescribing.\n\nAntibiotic courses prescribed by family practitioners accounted for 25% of all prescriptions, more than for any other specialty.\n\nFamily practitioners represented the second most common provider in our study, so this finding was not unexpected.\n\nGiven the high volume of prescribing among family practitioners, efforts to further characterize their prescribing practices may identify where the greatest gains could be made to improve antibiotic prescribing.\n\nAn unanticipated finding was the contribution of prescribing by dentists (10% of antibiotic courses).\n\nA recent study reported poor adherence to treatment guidelines and a high frequency of inappropriate prescribing among dentists, a prescriber group for which appropriate antibiotic use education has not been targeted in the United States [25].\n\nAlthough treatment guidelines for the most common bacterial infections (eg, bacterial rhinosinusitis, streptococcal pharyngitis, and otitis media) recommend \u03b2-lactams as first-line therapy [26, 27], azithromycin was the most frequently prescribed antibiotic overall.\n\nStudies have shown that broad-spectrum antibiotics, especially macrolides, are frequently prescribed for conditions for which an antibiotic is not indicated (eg, bronchitis) or when a \u03b2-lactam is the drug of choice (eg, pediatric pneumonia) [12, 28\u201330].\n\nGuidelines for treatment of mild or moderate pediatric pneumonia in otherwise healthy children recommend amoxicillin as the first-line agent for school-aged children; macrolides are recommended only for school-aged children and adolescents with findings compatible with atypical pneumonia [31].\n\nFor treatment of common infections in adults, community-acquired pneumonia is one of the few syndromes for which macrolides are recommended as first-line therapy [32].\n\nHigh prescribing of macrolides is probably explained by effective marketing strategies, patient demand [33], and convenient packaging and dosing (due to the drugs' long half-life and broad-spectrum activity) [34].\n\nUnfortunately the characteristics that make macrolides desirable from a treatment perspective also promote resistance.\n\nCiprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone approved only for treatment of adult infections, was the fourth most commonly prescribed antibiotic overall.\n\nAlthough ciprofloxacin is widely used to treat episodes of urinary tract infection [35], it is not recommended as the first-line agent, except when allergy is present or the prevalence of resistance to a first-line agent is known to be high [36].\n\nInterventions targeting appropriate quinolone use hold promise for great impact; the prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance among common community-associated pathogens (eg, Streptococcus pneumoniae) is low [37], representing an opportunity to minimize the spread of resistance.\n\nFluoroquinolones are also important for treatment of gram-negative infections; fluoroquinolone resistance is increasingly common among gram-negative pathogens, and prior fluoroquinolone use has been shown to be a risk factor for colonization with fluoroquinolone-resistant Escherichia coli [38, 39].\n\nAlthough our results represent a census of antibiotic prescribing in the outpatient setting, it is challenging to assess appropriateness because our data do not capture patient visits and diagnoses.\n\nThere are no established benchmarks for the amount of US antibiotic prescribing that is assumed to be appropriate and to which we can make comparisons.\n\nFurthermore, we chose prescriptions per 1000 persons as our unit of measurement, so our results are not directly comparable to studies of European prescribing rates where defined daily doses have been used.\n\nOur data set did not contain information about dosing frequency and duration of therapy; therefore, several assumptions would have been required to calculate defined daily doses.\n\nWhen evaluating antibiotic use in children, prescriptions per 1000 persons is a more accurate measure, because the defined daily dose is calculated based on the average adult dosage [40].\n\nPrescribing data may not accurately represent actual consumption of antibiotics, because we only captured prescriptions that were filled by pharmacies, and patient adherence to medication regimens varies.\n\nAlthough we believe that nonprescription use of antibiotics is low, we were unable to account for antibiotics that may have been obtained without a prescription (eg, the Internet).\n\nMoreover, our statistical analyses relied on county-level data to test associations between population characteristics and prescribing, so our results may not reflect the individual-level characteristics associated with prescribing.\n\nIn response to growing concern for antibiotic resistance, many organizations have launched initiatives to improve antibiotic use, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nThe CDC's Get Smart: Know When Antibiotics Work program (www.cdc.gov/getsmart) will be using the results of this study to identify opportunities for intervention and assess future progress toward improvement in antibiotic use.\n\nImproving antibiotic prescribing has the added benefit of reducing antibiotic-associated adverse events, such as Clostridium difficile colitis.\n\nThese efforts will be concentrated in the regions and among the providers and populations where antibiotic prescribing is the highest.\n\nAccordingly, improving our understanding of the factors that contribute to lower antibiotic prescribing rates in the West may inform efforts to improve prescribing in the South.\n\nPrimary care providers, who prescribe the most prescriptions, in particular family practitioners, should be targeted for appropriate antibiotic use education.\n\nCharacterization of prescribing patterns in dentists may reveal previously unrecognized opportunities to curb prescribing.\n\nInterventions to improve antibiotic prescribing should address both overprescribing and inappropriate antibiotic choice.\n\nPublic health, the healthcare community and the private sector must all work together to identify opportunities to safely and effectively reduce inappropriate antibiotic use in order to improve healthcare quality, lower costs, and reduce antibiotic selection pressure that leads to resistant infections.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section Notes

and Evgeny A.\n\nNudler) Significance The global burden of antibiotic resistance has created a demand to better understand the basic mechanisms of existing antibiotics.\n\nOf significant interest is how antibiotics may perturb bacterial metabolism, and how bacterial metabolism may influence antibiotic activity.\n\nHere, we study the interaction of bacteriostatic and bactericidal antibiotics, the two major phenotypic drug classes.\n\nInterestingly, the two classes differentially perturb bacterial cellular respiration, with major consequences for their intrinsic activity both alone and in combination.\n\nOf note, bacteriostatic antibiotics decelerate cellular respiration, generating a metabolic state that is prohibitive to killing.\n\nFurther, we show that the efficacy of bactericidal drugs can be improved by increasing basal respiration, and we identify a respiration-related drug target that potentiates the activity of bactericidal antibiotics.\n\nNext Section Abstract Bacteriostatic and bactericidal antibiotic treatments result in two fundamentally different phenotypic outcomes\u2014the inhibition of bacterial growth or, alternatively, cell death.\n\nMost antibiotics inhibit processes that are major consumers of cellular energy output, suggesting that antibiotic treatment may have important downstream consequences on bacterial metabolism.\n\nWe hypothesized that the specific metabolic effects of bacteriostatic and bactericidal antibiotics contribute to their overall efficacy.\n\nWe leveraged the opposing phenotypes of bacteriostatic and bactericidal drugs in combination to investigate their activity.\n\nGrowth inhibition from bacteriostatic antibiotics was associated with suppressed cellular respiration whereas cell death from most bactericidal antibiotics was associated with accelerated respiration.\n\nIn combination, suppression of cellular respiration by the bacteriostatic antibiotic was the dominant effect, blocking bactericidal killing.\n\nGlobal metabolic profiling of bacteriostatic antibiotic treatment revealed that accumulation of metabolites involved in specific drug target activity was linked to the buildup of energy metabolites that feed the electron transport chain.\n\nInhibition of cellular respiration by knockout of the cytochrome oxidases was sufficient to attenuate bactericidal lethality whereas acceleration of basal respiration by genetically uncoupling ATP synthesis from electron transport resulted in potentiation of the killing effect of bactericidal antibiotics.\n\nThis work identifies a link between antibiotic-induced cellular respiration and bactericidal lethality and demonstrates that bactericidal activity can be arrested by attenuated respiration and potentiated by accelerated respiration.\n\nOur data collectively show that antibiotics perturb the metabolic state of bacteria and that the metabolic state of bacteria impacts antibiotic efficacy.\n\nE.\n\ncoli S.\n\naureus antibiotics cellular respiration metabolomics Bacteriostatic antibiotics inhibit cell growth whereas bactericidal antibiotics induce cell death.\n\nClassifying an antibiotic as bacteriostatic or bactericidal is based on an operational in vitro test (1), which offers a limited perspective on the physiologic activity of the antibiotic.\n\nAlthough the clinical value of bactericidal activity in the treatment of infection is a point of debate (1, 2), evidence supports a preference for bactericidal antibiotics for certain high-risk infections (2\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u20138).\n\nThe use of antibiotic combinations to treat bacterial infections is increasingly common, but the predictability of this approach is limited (9, 10).\n\nIt is well-known that bacteriostatic\u2013bactericidal combination treatments result in attenuation of bactericidal activity in vitro across a range of drugs and organisms (11\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u201318).\n\nClinically, this effect can have negative consequences in high morbidity infections like meningitis (19, 20), or positive effects by inhibiting lysis and exotoxin release in toxin-mediated syndromes (21, 22).\n\nHow bacteriostatic antibiotics can block bactericidal lethality, however, is not well-understood.\n\nRecent lines of evidence have suggested that antibiotics induce cellular metabolic shifts as a secondary response to their target interaction.\n\nThe generation of antagonistic metabolic responses may be one possible means by which bacteriostatic and bactericidal antibiotics interact.\n\nThe predominant cellular process targeted by bacteriostatic antibiotics is translation, which is thought to account for a major portion of the energy consumption in the cell at steady state (23, 24).\n\nConsequently, disruption of this process may cause significant changes in cellular energy dynamics (25).\n\nIn support of this notion, the proteomic response to the bacteriostatic antibiotic chlortetracycline involves down-regulation of major metabolic pathways (26), potentially suggesting a reduction in metabolic rates.\n\nIn comparison with the bacteriostatic response, evidence suggests that bactericidal agents may increase cellular metabolic rates and that bactericidal antibiotic efficacy may relate directly to metabolic state (27).\n\nThe transcriptional response to bactericidal antibiotics involves up-regulation of genes involved in central metabolism and respiration (28\u21d3\u201330).\n\nDirect metabolomic profiling of Mycobacterium tuberculosis treated with a range of bactericidal agents demonstrated commonalities in remodeling of central metabolism in response to therapy (31).\n\nWith regard to cellular metabolic state, the efficacy of bactericidal antibiotic therapy has been linked to carbon flux through the TCA cycle (32, 33), and environmental factors that engage with central metabolism, such as the availability of molecular oxygen to feed the electron transport chain, have also been linked to cell killing by antibiotics (34, 35).\n\nPrevious work has indicated that the cellular response to bactericidal antibiotics leads to overflow metabolism and the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as part of their lethality (29, 35, 36), suggesting that accelerated metabolism is a key component of bactericidal activity.\n\nConsistent with this hypothesis, we have previously identified divergent effects of bactericidal antibiotics and the bacteriostatic translation inhibitor chloramphenicol on cellular respiration in Escherichia coli (35).\n\nIn the present study, we assess the long-known phenotype of bacteriostatic and bactericidal antibiotic antagonism to address how antibiotics perturb bacterial metabolism and how cellular metabolic state influences antibiotic efficacy.\n\nWe find that perturbation of cellular respiration is a major byproduct of antibiotic\u2013target interaction.\n\nFurther, changes in basal rates of cellular respiration can specifically tune the efficacy of bactericidal antibiotics.\n\nWe identify that bacteriostatic antibiotics generate a metabolic state in bacteria that is prohibitive to killing, which may relate directly to the clinical outcomes identified in combination therapy.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section Results Bacteriostatic Antibiotics Decelerate Cellular Respiration.\n\nTo assess physiologic changes induced by bacteriostatic and bactericidal antibiotics at the level of cellular respiration, we used a recently described real-time prokaryotic respiration assay using the SeaHorse XFe extracellular flux analyzer (35).\n\nThis platform measures real-time oxygen consumption rate (OCR) at picomole resolution, which we use as a proxy of cellular respiration (37)(Fig.\n\n1 and Fig.\n\nS1).\n\nThe assay detects oxygen using a solid-state sensor probe in a fluid chamber above a bacterial cell monolayer; thus, oxygen does not need to additionally diffuse through the probe solution matrix.\n\nWe optimized the assay performance for cell input (Fig.\n\nS1A) and validated that OCR is dependent upon the presence of metabolizable carbon sources (Fig.\n\nS1B).\n\nThe assay performed in M9 medium (in E.\n\ncoli) limits growth effects, results in linear increases in OCR over time (Fig.\n\n1A), and does not require normalization (35).\n\nStaphylococcus aureus respiration in minimal media fell below the limit of detection, and thus we adapted the assay to a standard rich media [tryptic soy broth (TSB)], which demonstrated logarithmic increases in OCR (consistent with more rapid doubling rates) and required normalization using instantaneous live\u2013dead staining (35) (Fig.\n\n1B).\n\nView larger version: In this window In a new window Download PPT Fig.\n\n1.\n\nAntibiotics perturb bacterial respiration.\n\nReal-time changes in oxygen consumption rate (OCR, in picomoles of molecular oxygen per minute) in response to antibiotic treatment in E.\n\ncoli and S.\n\naureus were measured on a Seahorse XFe Extracellular Flux Analyzer.\n\n(A, Left) OCR of E.\n\ncoli treated with the following bacteriostatic antibiotics (5\u00d7 MIC): tetracycline (Tet), spectinomycin (Spect), erythromycin (Erm), or chloramphenicol (Cam), compared with media plus

\u03bcg/mL).\n\n(Right) E.\n\ncoli OCR measurement with a dose range of norfloxacin (ng/mL, MIC = 50 ng/mL) over time.\n\nData represent mean \u00b1 SEM of eight replicates.\n\nWhere appropriate, statistical analysis is shown (*P \u2264 0.01).\n\nTreatment of E.\n\ncoli with bacteriostatic translation inhibitors resulted in rapid deceleration of cellular respiration (Fig.\n\n1A, Left).\n\nThis effect was evident as early as 6 min after exposure to drug and was sustained (Fig.\n\nS1C).\n\nIn contrast, three canonical bactericidal antibiotics [ampicillin (Amp), gentamicin (Gent), and norfloxacin (Nor)] accelerated respiration (Fig.\n\n1A, Right) with varying kinetics.\n\nRifampin (Rif), commonly considered bacteriostatic in E.\n\ncoli and bactericidal in S.\n\naureus (Fig.\n\nS2), potently suppressed OCR in E.\n\ncoli (Fig.\n\n1A, Right).\n\nTreatment of S.\n\naureus with bacteriostatic translation inhibitors also resulted in rapid inhibition of OCR (Fig.\n\n1B, Upper Left).\n\nOCR measurements from bactericidal treatment of S.\n\naureus without normalization demonstrated distinct dynamics from bacteriostatic antibiotics (Fig.\n\n1B, Lower Left).\n\nNormalization for instantaneous live cells yielded accelerated OCR by levofloxacin (Levo) but not daptomycin (Dapto) whereas normalization showed consistent deceleration from chloramphenicol (Cam) treatment (Fig.\n\n1B, Bottom Right).\n\nDapto treatment resulted in very high propidium iodide-positive cells, as expected, due to an increase in cell permeability as a major component of its activity (Fig.\n\nS1D).\n\nRif treatment of S.\n\naureus, which exhibits time-dependent killing rather than concentration-dependent killing (Fig.\n\nS2), rapidly suppressed OCR in a pattern consistent with other bacteriostatic antibiotics (Fig.\n\n1B, Upper Right).\n\nThus, bacteriostatic translation inhibitors broadly decelerate cellular respiration whereas most bactericidal antibiotics accelerate respiration.\n\nDapto had a neutral effect on respiration whereas Rif suppressed respiration in S.\n\naureus despite killing.\n\nWe next explored respiration effects caused by antibiotics around the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC).\n\nOCR was monitored in E.\n\ncoli treated with Cam (MIC 6 \u03bcg/mL) from 1.5 \u03bcg /mL (1/4\u00d7 MIC) to 24 \u03bcg/mL (4\u00d7 MIC).\n\nDeceleration of OCR was maximally achieved at the MIC concentration (Fig.\n\n1C), with no substantial changes by higher concentrations.\n\nSub-MIC Cam resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of OCR (Fig.\n\n1C).\n\nIn comparison, treatment of E.\n\ncoli with Nor from 12.5 ng/mL (1/4\u00d7 MIC) to 1 \u03bcg/mL (20\u00d7 MIC) demonstrated dynamic elevations in respiration with maximal acceleration of OCR observed at the MIC (Fig.\n\n1C).\n\nInterestingly, exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of Nor was sufficient to accelerate cellular respiration (Fig.\n\n1C).\n\nRespiration-Decelerating Antibiotics Block Lethality of Respiration-Accelerating Antibiotics.\n\nHaving observed divergent effects on cellular respiration by bacteriostatic and bactericidal antibiotics, we next assessed the outcome of combination treatments on cell survival.\n\nWe performed a pairwise lethality screen of 36 clinically relevant bacteriostatic-bactericidal antibiotic combinations in both E.\n\ncoli (16 combinations) and S.\n\naureus (20 combinations) by time-kill analysis (Fig.\n\n2 and Fig.\n\nS3).\n\nWe assessed the effect of bacteriostatic treatment before or after bactericidal challenge on cell survival (Fig.\n\n2 A and B).\n\nRif did not kill E.\n\ncoli up to 80\u00d7 MIC (Fig.\n\nS2) but did cause robust killing in S.\n\naureus with time-dependent kinetics, as opposed to respiration-enhancing antibiotics (Fig.\n\nS2).\n\nView larger version: In this window In a new window Download PPT Fig.\n\n2.\n\nBacteriostatic antibiotics disrupt bactericidal lethality.\n\n(A) Time-kill analysis was performed on E.\n\ncoli or S.\n\naureus with bacteriostatic-bactericidal antibiotic pairs.\n\nPretreatment: Bacteria were initially treated with bacteriostatic antibiotics (5\u00d7 MIC) and subsequently challenged with bactericidal drugs.\n\nPosttreatment: Bacteria received initial bactericidal challenge, and bacteriostatic drugs were added second.\n\n(B) Representative time-kill analysis of norfloxacin and chloramphenicol combination.\n\nIn all screens, combination therapy was compared against monotherapy with the single bacteriostatic and bactericidal

first.\n\nBactericidal monotherapy (red) is followed by pretreatment (white) and posttreatment approaches (light gray).\n\nChloramphenicol (Cam); clindamycin (Clin); erythromycin (Erm); linezolid

or rifampin monotherapy, compared with pretreatment or posttreatment with rifampin.\n\n(F) Time-kill curves of S.\n\naureus treated with levofloxacin, gentamicin, daptomycin, or rifampin with rifampin pre- or posttreatment.\n\nCurves show mean \u00b1 SEM of three independent experiments.\n\nIn E.\n\ncoli, all bacteriostatic antibiotics potently inhibited cell killing by several orders of magnitude, when applied before bactericidal antibiotics (Fig.\n\n2 B and C and Fig.\n\nS3), and rapidly attenuated killing by bactericidal antibiotics when delivered after 30 min of initial bactericidal exposure (Fig.\n\n2 B and C and Fig.\n\nS3).\n\nNo combination of bacteriostatic antibiotics showed killing with Rif in E.\n\ncoli (Fig.\n\n2C and Fig.\n\nS3).\n\nSimilarly, in S.\n\naureus we observed broad and potent protection by preincubation with any bacteriostatic antibiotic before bactericidal challenge (Fig.\n\n2D and Fig.\n\nS3).\n\nBacteriostatic pretreatment of cells did not offer complete protection from Dapto challenge, consistent with its known effect on membrane integrity and charge-based mode of action (38).\n\nWe again observed rapid interruption of cell killing after initial bactericidal treatment with any bacteriostatic drug (Fig.\n\n2D and Fig.\n\nS3).\n\nWe observed no impact of any bacteriostatic antibiotic on cell killing by Rif (Fig.\n\n2D and Fig.\n\nS3).\n\nTaken together, this screen demonstrates that bacteriostatic translation inhibitors generally inhibit killing caused by a wide range of bactericidal antibiotics with differing cellular targets.\n\nThe most notable exception was Rif in our S.\n\naureus model, where lethality was not sensitive to bacteriostatic antibiotic cotreatment.\n\nDue to the respiration-decelerating phenotype of Rif, we hypothesized that Rif-mediated killing would be antagonistic to respiration accelerators.\n\nConsistent with this proposal, we observed potent protection of E.\n\ncoli by Rif from killing by Nor, Amp, and Gent, and rapid arrest in killing when Rif was added after bactericidal challenge (Fig.\n\n2E), similar to bacteriostatic translation inhibitors.\n\nRif is bactericidal in S.\n\naureus; however, due to its time-dependent killing, we could compare Rif killing in combination with concentrations of Levo, Gent, and Dapto that produced more killing by at least an order of magnitude.\n\nIn combination, we observed that Rif protected against the additional lethality induced by Levo or Gent (Fig.\n\n2F).\n\nWe did not observe any protection against killing by Dapto, consistent with the lack of respiration acceleration observed for this drug.\n\nThus, Rif, which induces bacteriostatic-like respiratory changes, inhibits the lethality of respiration-accelerating bactericidal antibiotics similar to other bacteriostatic drugs.\n\nBacteriostatic Alterations to the Metabolome Correspond to Respiratory Deceleration.\n\nGiven the divergent effects of bacteriostatic and bactericidal antibiotics on cellular respiration, we sought to characterize antibiotic-induced metabolic changes more broadly.\n\nIn particular, we were interested in the dominant effect of respiration-decelerating antibiotics and whether this phenotype was derived from the general metabolic state of the cell.\n\nWe profiled the metabolome of S.\n\naureus treated with the respiration-decelerating antibiotics Cam, Lin, and Rif.\n\nWe compared untreated cells at time 0 (UT0) with either a growth control (UT30) or cells exposed to antibiotic for 30 min.\n\nOur analysis yielded 353 robustly identified metabolites comprising eight superpathways and 63 subpathways (Fig.\n\nS4).\n\nHierarchical clustering of the metabolomics data identified broad trends across treatment conditions (Fig.\n\n3A).\n\nWe observed a marked progression of metabolism in the untreated sample between the 0-min and 30-min time points (Fig.\n\n3A), reflecting growth during exponential phase.\n\nTreatment with the translation inhibitors Cam and Lin yielded indistinguishable metabolic profiles, characterized by elevation in two clusters of metabolites.\n\nThe first group aligns with elevated metabolites in the UT0 sample and is enriched for amino acids (P = 2.16 \u00d7 10\u22129, hypergeometric test), suggesting an arrest in metabolic progression for these target-specific compounds.\n\nThe second cluster is enriched for lipids (P = 1.66 \u00d7 10\u22129, hypergeometric test) and shows higher concentrations than either the UT0 or UT30 samples.\n\nRif elicited a unique metabolic response, sharing some aspects of the translation inhibitors, but others that were unique (Fig.\n\n3A).\n\nView larger version: In this window In a new window Download PPT Fig.\n\n3.\n\nBroad metabolite accumulation observed in bacteriostatic-treated S.\n\naureus.\n\nIn A, B, and C, UT0 represents metabolite levels at the time of antibiotic addition; UT30 represents 30 min of growth in the absence of antibiotics.\n\nCam, Lin, and Rif treatments were assessed 30 min after exposure.\n\n(A) Hierarchical clustering of log-transformed and autoscaled relative metabolite

shapes represent metabolites having a fold-change greater than two and P value less than 0.05; gray shapes represent metabolites that are not significantly changing.\n\nFold changes are relative to UT30 control and are based on mean values of five independent experiments.\n\nWe noted accumulation of ATP, ADP, and AMP specifically in response to respiration-decelerating antibiotics, consistent with decreased ATP utilization (Fig.\n\n3B and Fig.\n\nS5), as well as a significant elevation in NADH, with more modest elevation in NAD+, suggesting a lowered redox state (Fig.\n\n3B).\n\nWe observed significant elevations in metabolites from central carbon metabolism (Fig.\n\n3C, Lower Left), which, coupled to the energy state of the cell, suggested decreased metabolic rates.\n\nFurther exploration of the metabolomics profiles revealed a striking accumulation of metabolites involved in transcription and translation, the specific targets of the drugs queried (Fig.\n\n3C).\n\nCam and Lin treatment resulted in marked accumulation of amino acids and amino acid precursors, indicative of decreased flux into polypeptide production (Fig.\n\n3C, Upper Left).\n\nSimilarly, Rif induced substantial increases in nucleotide and nucleotide precursors, consistent with inhibition of RNA production (Fig.\n\n3C, Upper Right).\n\nInterestingly, Rif treatment also induced substantial accumulation of amino acid precursors whereas the translation inhibitors caused accumulation of nucleotides, consistent with the secondary arrest in cell turnover and DNA replication induced by these drugs.\n\nAll three antibiotics resulted in significant accumulation of lipid and lipid precursors (Fig.\n\n3C, Lower Right), which may be due to reduced utilization as an energy source or decreased cell turnover.\n\nTaken together, the metabolomics data indicate that inhibition of either transcription or translation results in the accumulation of energy currency and central metabolites coupled to a lower redox state, suggesting the association of reduced rates of respiration with lower overall metabolic rates, which derive from the arrest of a major macromolecular synthetic process.\n\nAttenuated Respiration Is Associated with Killing Arrest.\n\nBecause bacteriostatic and bactericidal antibiotics stimulate competing effects on cellular respiration, we assessed the respiratory outcome of exposure to antibiotics in combination.\n\nWe measured OCR of E.\n\ncoli treated with the bacteriostatic antibiotic Cam 30 min before the addition of bactericidal antibiotics (Nor, Amp, Gent) (Fig.\n\n4A).\n\nTreatment of cells in series was compared with cells given Cam alone, bactericidal antibiotic alone, or no antibiotic.\n\nCells pretreated with Cam (asterisk) before bactericidal challenge (arrowhead) showed no detectable acceleration in cellular respiration after the addition of the bactericidal drug (Fig.\n\n4A).\n\nSimilarly, Cam addition after initial bactericidal treatment (arrowhead) resulted in immediate and potent suppression of OCR (Fig.\n\n4B).\n\nSimilar effects were observed for S.\n\naureus (Fig.\n\nS6A).\n\nWe asked whether prolonged treatment with bactericidal antibiotics would negate the effect of bacteriostatic suppression.\n\nE.\n\ncoli were treated with Nor to initialize cell killing, followed by Cam at 30 or 60 min later.\n\nEven at 60 min, Cam addition rapidly attenuated cellular respiration and cell death (Fig.\n\n4C).\n\nSimilar results were obtained for Amp (Fig.\n\nS6B).\n\nIndependent of the timing of addition, deceleration of cellular respiration driven by the bacteriostatic antibiotic was the dominant phenotype in combination treatment, consistent with the time\u2013kill effect.\n\nView larger

60 min.\n\nAccelerating Basal Respiration Potentiates Bactericidal Killing.\n\nThe metabolomics data suggested that bacteriostatic inhibition of cellular respiration may be a byproduct of translation inhibition.\n\nInhibition of translation may have additional nonmetabolic effects on the cell that could be the source of attenuated bactericidal activity.\n\nTo assess whether cellular respiration itself was an important factor in bactericidal activity, we assessed cell killing in a genetic mutant lacking the three major cytochrome oxidases (\u0394cyoA \u0394cydB \u0394appB).\n\nThis mutant has previously been reported to have reduced rates of cellular respiration (39), which we confirmed in our assay (Fig.\n\n5A).\n\nTreatment of cytochrome oxidase null bacteria with norfloxacin resulted in no appreciable acceleration of respiration (Fig.\n\n5A, Right).\n\nWhen we assessed killing by bactericidal antibiotics, we found that the cytochrome oxidase null mutant was highly protected from the lethal effects of Nor, Amp, and Gent (Fig.\n\n5B).\n\nProtection from Gent killing is likely related to the breakdown in proton motive force, leading to reduced drug uptake.\n\nIn addition, consistent with previous results (39), we observed a reduced growth rate of the cytochrome oxidase null mutant relative to the WT, which may have affected its susceptibility to ampicillin.\n\nView larger

killing by bactericidal antibiotics.\n\nWe sought to uncouple electron transport from ATP production in E.\n\ncoli.\n\nThe known inhibitors of the F1F0 ATPase, oligomycin and venturicidin, do not have activity in E.\n\ncoli whole-cell assays (40).\n\nLacking a chemical approach, we used a knockout of the catalytic domain of the F1F0 ATPase (\u0394atpA), which is a nonessential gene given the capacity for fermentative growth.\n\nPrior in silico models have predicted an elevated redox state in this mutant (41).\n\nWe found that the \u0394atpA mutant grew at the same rate as WT E.\n\ncoli but reached stationary phase faster, potentially consistent with reduced efficiency of carbon utilization (Fig.\n\n5C and Fig.\n\nS7A).\n\nMeasurement of the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) of this strain further confirmed a substantially higher rate of acid secretion, as expected in fermentative growth (Fig.\n\n5E).\n\nInterestingly, we observed threefold elevations in basal OCR in this strain, indicating uncoupling of respiration from ATP production and a compensatory rise in respiration (Fig.\n\n5D).\n\nWe confirmed that these optical density-matched OCR variations were not due to differences in growth rate, to total cell numbers plated, or to the density of cells in the experiment (Fig.\n\nS7).\n\nTreatment of the \u0394atpA strain with Amp and Nor resulted in substantially increased killing (Fig.\n\n5F).\n\nWe found a leftward shift in the gentamicin minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) curve, consistent with a likely increase in drug uptake due to elevated proton motive force from altered respiration (Fig.\n\n5F).\n\nWe were further interested in how bacteriostatic antibiotic treatment may protect against killing in the context of an accelerated basal respiration state.\n\nIn time\u2013kill analysis, the \u0394atpA mutant exhibited approximately two orders of magnitude of increased killing relative to WT (Fig.\n\n5G).\n\nPretreatment with Cam for 30 min, followed by Nor challenge, led to breakthrough killing in the \u0394atpA mutant (Fig.\n\n5H).\n\nInterestingly, Cam treatment of the \u0394atpA mutant decelerates OCR, but with high levels of residual respiration present in this mutant relative to the WT (Fig.\n\n5I).\n\nThus, elevated basal respiration increases killing by respiration-accelerating bactericidal antibiotics.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section Discussion A key concept supported by this work is that inhibition of antibiotic targets results in downstream metabolic perturbations.\n\nThe direction of the shift, however, seems to depend upon the function of the target that is inhibited and is linked to the bacteriostatic or bactericidal outcome.\n\nInhibition of macromolecular synthesis (i.e., transcription or translation) was associated with decreased bacterial cellular respiration.\n\nInterestingly, the majority of bacteriostatic antibiotics inhibit protein production (42), which as a process is the largest single consumer of total metabolic output (23, 43).\n\nWe observed a marked accumulation of amino acids and nucleotides in response to translation and transcription inhibitors, respectively, reflective of reduced incorporation into peptide or RNA chains.\n\nIn addition, we observed accumulation of amino acid and nucleotide precursors, indicative of bottlenecking of flux from these pools as a direct result of bacteriostatic antibiotic activity.\n\nThis effect on amino acid and nucleotide metabolism was associated with the accumulation of central carbon metabolites, the flow of which powers the electron transport chain.\n\nPrior metabolomic and proteomic analyses of bacteriostatic antibiotic treatments have suggested that central metabolism is suppressed in response to bacteriostatic antibiotic treatment (26, 44).\n\nOur data further support this model, suggesting that inhibition of these core cellular processes may reduce energy demand and secondarily suppress rates of cellular respiration and ATP production (25).\n\nOn the other hand, most canonical bactericidal antibiotics were associated with accelerated respiratory activity in our study and others (35).\n\nIt has been hypothesized that bactericidal antibiotics lead to metabolic instability and the formation of toxic ROS as part of their lethality (28, 29, 35, 36).\n\nAcceleration of cellular respiration by bactericidal antibiotics may be a potential source of ROS (45).\n\nOur work supports this model by showing that tuning rates of basal cellular respiration can significantly impact bactericidal efficacy.\n\nWhat remains unclear is how bactericidal antibiotic target inhibition may lead to acceleration of cellular respiration.\n\nBecause bacteriostatic antibiotics arrest a metabolically costly process and reduce ATP demand, it is possible that bactericidal antibiotics may aberrantly increase metabolic demand by virtue of their drug\u2013target interaction.\n\nIn support of this notion, a recent study on the \u03b2-lactam mechanism of action revealed that these drugs cause the formation of a futile cycle in the production and degradation of peptidoglycan (46).\n\nThe formation of a macromolecular futile cycle may accelerate cellular respiration to meet the metabolic demand of dead-end peptidoglycan synthesis.\n\nIdentification of the mechanism by which \u03b2-lactams, quinolones, aminoglycosides, and other bactericidal antibiotics accelerate respiration requires further study.\n\nUnder aerobic conditions, E.\n\ncoli uses a branched electron transport chain composed of two NADH-quinone oxidoreductases and three quinol oxidases that efficiently couple electron exchange to ATP production by the F1F0 ATPase (37, 47).\n\nManipulation of the rate of cellular respiration directly by gene knockout resulted in significant perturbations in bactericidal killing, suggesting a specific role for respiration in antibiotic lethality.\n\nInterestingly, several promising antibiotic leads have recently been characterized that target energy production by inhibiting components of the electron transport chain directly (48, 49).\n\nThe F1F0 ATPase is the target of bedaquiline, a novel antibiotic for the treatment of tuberculosis (50, 51).\n\nThe mechanism of action has been thought to be due to depletion of available energy currency (52); however, more recent analysis has revealed that it uncouples cellular respiration from ATP synthesis, resulting in a futile proton cycle that is linked to cell death (53).\n\nThe degree of respiratory acceleration caused by knockout of the F1F0 catalytic domain in E.\n\ncoli in our study (Fig.\n\n5) was very similar to that produced by chemical inhibition by bedaquiline, suggesting that inhibition of catalysis by the ATPase may be a general strategy to induce metabolic dysfunction in bacteria.\n\nInterestingly, inhibition of the F1F0 ATPase has been shown to lead to increased ROS production in eukaryotes (54) and could potentially lead to a similar outcome in bacteria.\n\nOur data suggest that chemically targeting the bacterial F1F0 ATPase could serve as means to boost the activity of bactericidal antibiotics and represents an intriguing target for antibiotic adjuvant therapy.\n\nAntibiotics are effective because they inhibit critical functional components of bacterial cellular architecture.\n\nThe concept of a \u201cbacteriostatic\u201d or \u201cbactericidal\u201d antibiotic has largely rested on phenomenological changes in cell state.\n\nOur data extend these concepts by demonstrating that these phenotypic outcomes are, in part, a direct reflection of the metabolic perturbation induced by target inhibition.\n\nWe showed that growth inhibition associated with bacteriostatic antibiotics is linked to suppression of cellular respiration and broader metabolism.\n\nCell death from bactericidal antibiotics, on the other hand, drives acceleration of respiration, and perturbation of the basal level of metabolism significantly impacts the efficacy of bactericidal therapy.\n\nOverall, our data support the hypothesis that antibiotics alter the metabolic state of bacteria, contributing to the resulting lethality, stasis, or tolerance, and, further, that the existing metabolic environment of bacteria influences their susceptibility to antibiotics.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section Methods Strains, Media, and Growth Conditions.\n\nE.\n\ncoli K12 strain MG1655 and S.\n\naureus strain ATCC 25923 were used in this study.\n\nThe E.\n\ncoli \u0394atpA and \u0394cyoA \u0394cydB \u0394appB mutants were constructed by P1 transduction from the Keio collection.\n\nE.\n\ncoli was cultured in M9 minimal media (Fisher), supplemented with 0.2% casamino acids and 10 mM glucose.\n\nS.\n\naureus was cultured in tryptic soy broth (TSB) (Teknova).\n\nCells were grown at 37 \u00b0C on a rotating shaker at 300 rpm in flasks or at 900 rpm in plate shakers.\n\nAntibiotics and Chemicals.\n\nE.\n\ncoli cells were treated with bactericidal antibiotics at 5\u00d7 minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) (by macrobroth dilution): ampicillin (Amp) 10 \u03bcg\u22c5mL\u22121, norfloxacin (Nor) 250 ng\u22c5mL\u22121, gentamicin (Gent) 5 \u03bcg\u22c5mL\u22121.\n\nRifampin (Rif) was used at 5\u00d7 MIC (250 \u03bcg\u22c5mL\u22121) for consistency, despite the absence of detectable bactericidal activity.\n\nBacteriostatic antibiotics were used in the screen at 5\u00d7 MIC unless otherwise indicated: chloramphenicol (Cam) 50 \u03bcg\u22c5mL\u22121, erythromycin (Erm) 500 \u03bcg\u22c5mL\u22121, spectinomycin (Spect) 200 \u03bcg\u22c5mL\u22121, tetracycline (Tet) 10 \u03bcg\u22c5mL\u22121.\n\nFor S.\n\naureus, bactericidal antibiotics were used at 10\u00d7 MIC to generate biological equivalents of cell killing, unless otherwise indicated: levofloxacin (Levo) 2 \u03bcg\u22c5mL\u22121, Gent 5 \u03bcg\u22c5mL\u22121, daptomycin (Dapto) 16 \u03bcg\u22c5mL\u22121, rifampin (Rif) 125 ng\u22c5mL\u22121.\n\nDaptomycin treatments included 50 \u03bcg\u22c5mL\u22121 calcium chloride, as previously reported, for activity (55).\n\nBacteriostatic antibiotics were used, unless otherwise indicated, at 5\u00d7 MIC: Cam 50 \u03bcg\u22c5mL\u22121, linezolid (Lin) 25 \u03bcg\u22c5mL\u22121, clindamycin (Clin) 1 \u03bcg\u22c5mL\u22121, Erm 5 \u03bcg\u22c5mL\u22121, Tet 2 \u03bcg\u22c5mL\u22121.\n\nAll antibiotics were purchased from Sigma.\n\nBacterial Respiration.\n\nThe XFe96 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience) was used to quantitate oxygen consumption rates (OCRs) (35) and extracellular acidification rates (ECARs).\n\nAn overnight of MG1655 E.\n\ncoli cells was diluted 1:200 into fresh M9 media and grown to an OD600 of \u223c0.3. Cells were diluted to 2\u00d7 the final OD, and 90 \u03bcL of diluted cells was added to XF Cell Culture Microplates precoated with poly-d-lysine (PDL) (35).\n\nCells were centrifuged for 10 min at 1,400 \u00d7 g in a Heraeus Multifuge \u00d71R (M-20 rotor) to attach them to the precoated plates.\n\nAfter centrifugation, 90 \u03bcL of fresh M9 media was added to each well.\n\nTo assure uniform cellular seeding, initial OCR was measured for two cycles (7 min) before the injection of antibiotics.\n\nS.\n\naureus OCR experiments were run in a similar manner, with the exception that the cells were diluted into TSB after the initial LB overnight, and the OCR measurements were similarly run in TSB.\n\nMaximal OCR read on the SeaHorse is \u223c700\u2013800 pmol/min, after which point the consumption rate exceeds the replenishment of the system and curves show a false declination in OCR, which have been excluded from graphical presentation.\n\nOCR from S.\n\naureus grown in TSB was normalized to the number of viable cells quantitated using the LIVE/DEAD BacLight Bacterial Viability and Counting Kit-for Flow Cytometry (Life Technologies), according to kit instructions.\n\nFor this assay, cells were cultured and treated on a parallel XF Cell Culture Microplate and assayed at 30 min after the addition of antibiotics.\n\nTo prepare cells for measurement, 50 \u03bcL of cell culture was added to a 250-\u03bcL assay mix [20 \u03bcL of fluorescent beads, 10 \u03bcL of SYBR green DNA stain, and 20 \u03bcL of propidium iodide in a 10-mL assay medium (150 mM NaCl)] and incubated for 15 min before counting.\n\nMeasurements were made with a FACS Aria II flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson).\n\nThe following photomultiplier tube voltages were used: forward scatter (FSC) 200, side scatter 200, fluorescence signal 1A 325, fluorescence signal 2A 390.\n\nAcquisition was performed at a low flow rate (\u223c30 events per s), with thresholding on FSC at a value of 1,000.\n\nTime-Kill and MBC Analyses.\n\nFor time-kill analysis, overnight samples of E.\n\ncoli or S.\n\naureus were diluted 1:200 into 25 mL of fresh media and grown in a 250-mL baffled flask to an OD600 of \u223c0.2\u20130.3. Cells were then plated in a six-well dish, and antibiotics were added at the appropriate concentration.\n\nAt specified time points (30 min for E.\n\ncoli, and 15 min for S.\n\naureus), a second antibiotic or vehicle control was added to wells if indicated.\n\nThe difference in time of addition was related to the rate of growth in defined media (E.\n\ncoli) versus rich media (S.\n\naureus).\n\nAliquots of 300 \u03bcL were taken at specified times, serially diluted, and spot-plated onto LB agar plates to determine colony-forming units per mL (cfu\u22c5mL\u22121).\n\nDilutions that grew 10\u201350 colonies were counted.\n\nPercent survival was determined by dividing the cfu\u22c5mL\u22121 of a sample at each time point by the initial cfu\u22c5mL\u22121 of that sample.\n\nMinimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) curves were performed on MG1655, \u0394cyoA \u0394cydB \u0394appB, or the \u0394atpA mutant.\n\nOvernight cultures were diluted 1:200 in M9 medium and grown to OD 0.2. Cells were exposed to antibiotics at 1.5-fold dilutions for 90 min, and cfu analysis was performed.\n\nMetabolic Profiling.\n\nS.\n\naureus was grown in 100 mL of TSB in 1-L baffled flasks to an OD600 of \u223c0.2\u20130.3. Control cells were either collected at this time point (UT0), or cells were treated with antibiotics or vehicle.\n\nAntibiotics were added for 30 min: linezolid (Lin, 20 \u03bcg\u22c5mL\u22121), chloramphenicol (Cam, 50 \u03bcg\u22c5mL\u22121), and rifampin (Rif, 32 ng\u22c5mL\u22121) were all used at 4\u00d7 MIC.\n\nQuintuplicate samples were collected by centrifugation at 1,400 \u00d7 g \u00d7 5 min at 4 \u00b0C, washed once in ice cold PBS, and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen before metabolomic analysis.\n\nCells were lysed and assayed by Metabolon Inc.\n\nas previously described (56).\n\nRelative concentration data for each detected metabolite were normalized by BRADFORD protein concentration and scaled such that the median value across all samples was equal to one.\n\nOnly robustly identified metabolites, defined as metabolites being identified in at least three out of five of the replicates across all conditions, were retained for analysis.\n\nAll analyses were then performed in Matlab.\n\nThe k-nearest neighbors approach, with the standardized Euclidean distance metric, was used to impute remaining missing data.\n\nA Welch\u2019s two-sample t test was performed on log-transformed data to evaluate significant changes in metabolite abundance between conditions, and the mafdr Matlab function was used to correct for multiple hypothesis testing.\n\nHierarchical clustering (correlation and average were used as the distance and linkage metrics, respectively) and principal component analysis were performed on log-transformed and autoscaled metabolite data.\n\nBox plots were constructed in R using normalized relative concentration data.\n\nTo determine pathway enrichment, the hygecdf function was used to perform a hypergeometric test in Matlab.\n\nATP concentrations, which were not detected on the Metabolon platform, were determined using a bioluminescent assay (Sigma), with ATP concentration corrected by total protein as determined by BCA assay (Pierce).\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section Acknowledgments This work was supported by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (J.J.C.), National Institutes of Health Director\u2019s Pioneer

new antimicrobials.\n\nCO-releasing molecules (CORMs), mostly metal carbonyl compounds, originally developed for therapeutic CO delivery in animals, are potent antimicrobial agents.\n\nCertain CORMs inhibit growth and respiration, reduce viability, and release CO to intracellular hemes, as predicted, but their actions are more complex, as revealed by transcriptomic datasets and modeling.\n\nProgress is hindered by difficulties in detecting CO release intracellularly, limited understanding of the biological chemistry of CO reactions with non-heme targets, and the cytotoxicity of some CORMs to mammalian cells.\n\nantibiotic resistance bacterial metabolism carbon monoxide heme heme oxygenase metal homeostasis respiratory chain transport metal antimicrobial agents metal carbonyl compound Previous SectionNext Section Introduction It is axiomatic that metal ions are essential in biology, but also toxic in unregulated concentrations or locations.\n\nA corollary is that selectively toxic metal compounds (such as compounds of silver for infections resulting from burns and bismuth in fighting Helicobacter pylori) have long been used as antimicrobial compounds, antiseptics, and disinfectants (1).\n\nIt is therefore paradoxical that metal compounds are the most abundant class of compounds for delivering carbon monoxide (CO) for therapeutic purposes in higher organisms.\n\nAlthough CO is a respiratory poison, it has \u201ccome of age\u201d since the discovery that CO is a cytoprotective and homeostatic molecule and a vasodilator, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and anti-proliferative agent (2\u20134).\n\nThe biological chemistry of CO is relatively simple (when compared with O2 and the \u201cgasotransmitters\u201d NO and H2S) (5, 6).\n\nIts most important property is reaction with metals, famously ferrous heme proteins, although some heme-independent reactions are known, such as binding to iron in hydrogenases (7) and to binuclear copper sites, for example in hemocyanins (8).\n\nIn CO dehydrogenase, which oxidizes CO to CO2, CO interacts with the nickel ion in one of the metalloclusters (\u201cC-cluster\u201d) (9).\n\nHere we review the effects of CO and CO-releasing molecules (CORMs)2 on microorganisms, experiments that demonstrate the potential of CORMs, and highlight problems and prospects.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section Development and Applications of CORMs Resistance to antibiotics now threatens the effective prevention and treatment of microbial infections (10).\n\nThis scenario is not an apocalyptic fantasy, and has promoted research into the development of new antimicrobial agents.\n\nCORMs, originally developed for therapeutic delivery (3, 4), have recently been investigated for their antimicrobial activities, initially presumed to be mediated by CO.\n\nIf the delivery of CO to targets could be controlled and enhanced, it might be toxic to microorganisms; indeed, CO-supplemented gas atmospheres preserve meat from bacterial spoilage (11).\n\nHowever, microbes may also be relatively insensitive to the gas.\n\nAirborne bacteria survive high urban CO concentrations (12), and bacterial cultures may be bubbled with the gas (13); 250 ppm of CO is not toxic (14).\n\nFurthermore, CO per se is not selectively toxic to microbes; it is tolerated at about 3 mg/kg for 1 h in humans, and no toxic effects are evident in animal models at efficacious doses of the gas (when carbonmonoxyhemoglobin levels reach \u223c20%) (4).\n\nThe key to the use of CORMs as antimicrobials is that they are far more toxic to microbes than is CO, but the basis of this toxicity is poorly understood.\n\nMann (3) authoritatively reviews the discovery and development of CORMs. Early biological studies investigated binding to heme proteins, vasodilation, inhibition of NO production by macrophages (because CO deactivates inducible NO synthase while activating guanylyl cyclase), and survival of animals after organ transplantation (3, 15).\n\nAntimicrobial effects were not considered.\n\nNumerous CORMs have been reported and synthesized, but here and in Table 1, we describe only those that have been used against microbes or hold particular promise (16\u201326).\n\nTwo ruthenium compounds have been extensively used: CORM-2 and CORM-3.\n\nThe former has long been commercially available, but the latter has only recently been marketed.\n\nAlthough CORM-2 is soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide, the outstanding merit of CORM-3 is water solubility (27, 28).\n\nHowever, it has complex solution chemistry, and many aspects of its biological fate and CO release remain unresolved.\n\nIn water, CO release is slow so that solutions can be prepared and administered with ease, but CORM-3 releases CO rapidly in the standard assay that uses ferrous myoglobin as acceptor, leading to the description of CORM-3 as a rapid CO releaser (27) (but see below).\n\nView this table: In this window In a new window TABLE 1 CORMs referred to in this review Other CORMs are covered below where they have been used as antimicrobial agents.\n\nNewer compounds with desirable therapeutic effects are constantly appearing, but few have been tested microbiologically (29, 30).\n\nOf particular interest are CORMs in which the CO release can be precisely controlled both spatially and temporally, either by triggering the inactive \u201cprodrug\u201d with light (photoCORMs) (31) or by enzyme activation (32).\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section Analytical Methods as a Bottleneck in Understanding CORM Toxicity CO is generally assayed in environmental, clinical, or experimental situations by measuring the characteristic absorbance spectrum on reaction with myoglobin (above), or by GC-thermal conductivity detection (33, 34), solution IR spectroscopy (35), gas-phase IR absorption spectroscopy (36), attenuated total reflection IR spectroscopy of a metal carbonyl (37), chromogenic probes (38, 39), or metal oxide semiconductors (40).\n\nThe CO electrode produced by World Precision Instruments is potentially useful but has been little used to date (22).\n\nAn amperometric microsensor simultaneously measures NO and CO in mouse kidneys (40), but such electrodes are currently unsuitable for detecting and quantifying CO released inside microbes by CORMs. The standard laboratory method for detecting CORM-derived CO in vitro is the myoglobin assay (18) in which the liberated CO reacts with ferrous myoglobin to give a distinct CO adduct.\n\nThe method compares favorably with GC-thermal conductivity detection of CO (41).\n\nRefinements to the myoglobin assay were proposed (42), but we demonstrated that it is the reducing agent for myoglobin, sodium dithionite, that promotes CO release (43); CO is not released from CORM-3 in the absence of the reductant (43).\n\nIt might be explained by the fact that dithionite is not pure and contains a significant quantity of sulfite, which is in equilibrium with sulfur dioxide, a good ligand for transition metals.\n\nThis fits with the observation that, on dissolution in buffers in a closed vial, only CO2, resulting from the water-gas shift reaction, can be detected (by GC) (33).\n\nThe mechanism of CO release from CORM-3 remains unknown as its chemistry is complex (28), but decomposition products of CORM-3 react with exposed His residues on protein to give metalloproteins that spontaneously release CO (44).\n\nThus, in biological situations where dithionite (or sulfite, metabisulfite, or perhaps other species) are absent, the myoglobin assay overestimates the rate of CO release.\n\nLikewise, CORM-3 does not release CO to the purified flavohemoglobin (Hmp) when reduced with NADH but does so in the presence of dithionite (45).\n\nThese findings probably explain the discrepancy noted between the myoglobin assay and the CO electrode (22), previously attributed to the need for certain CORMs to interact \u201cwith biological components to trigger the release of CO\u201d (22).\n\nAn alternative assay that obviates the need for dithionite uses oxyhemoglobin (43).\n\nSuch globin assays could in principle be applied to CO assays within bacteria; indeed Escherichia coli Hmp expressed at high copy number is a sensitive monitor of CO liberated inside bacteria from CORMs (45).\n\nNewer methods with unrealized potential include FTIR and photothermally induced resonance to detect an organometallic carbonyl compound (not a CORM) in breast cancer cells (46).\n\nMore promising is Raman microspectroscopy to detect a manganese CORM [(Mn(tpm)(CO)3]Cl (tpm = tris(1-pyrazolyl)methane) in colon cancer cells (47).\n\nA genetically constructed fluorescent probe (COSer) comprises the CO binding selectivity of CooA, a dimeric CO-sensing heme protein from Rhodospirillum rubrum, and a fluorescent peptide to report conformational changes on binding CO (48).\n\nTransfection of HeLa cells with COSer allowed intracellular imaging of CO after treatment with CO or 1\u201310 \u03bcm CORM-2.\n\nA new fluorescent probe (COP-1) based on palladium-mediated carbonylation allowed selective CO detection in cells after CORM-3 treatment (49).\n\nCOP-1 has also been used in vitro to demonstrate CO release from a photoCORM in the presence of endothelial cells (35).\n\nZobi et al.\n\n(50) have shown via synchrotron FTIR spectromicroscopy that a photoactivated CORM conjugated to vitamin B12 is taken up by fibroblasts.\n\nA photoCORM that is also luminescent could be tracked by confocal fluorescence microscopy (51).\n\nThese methods have not been tested in bacteria, but the attainable spatial resolution appears at present inadequate for subcellular localization.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section CO Metabolism in Microorganisms: Implications for Pathogenesis To understand the possible mechanisms of action of CORMs, it is clearly important to appreciate how CO per se impacts on microorganisms.\n\nDNA replication is inhibited by CO (52), and the inhibition by CO of respiratory oxidases and globins at heme targets has been known since the days of Warburg and Keilin (reviewed in Ref.\n\n53).\n\nHowever, CO also binds to the di-iron site in bacterial NO reductases (54, 55) and to iron, copper, and nickel sites in certain microbial proteins, notably CO dehydrogenase (see above).\n\nThe relationship between CO and disease is complex, but clues come from the observation that cigarette smoking and CO, a component of smoke, have anti-inflammatory effects against ulcerative colitis (56).\n\nHowever, the major CO source in mammals is CO endogenously produced by heme oxygenase (HO)-1 (57).\n\nSeveral bacteria also possess HO enzymes that function to degrade heme that is imported for use as an iron source (58, 59).\n\nHO activity contributes to pathogenesis in certain bacteria by scavenging iron from heme (58, 60).\n\nThere is extensive literature on sensing of gases (O2, NO, CO) by mycobacteria and its role in dormancy.\n\nMycobacterium tuberculosis infection of macrophages and mice induces host HO-1 expression (61).\n\nThe CO thus produced, together with iNOS-derived NO, stimulates expression (via the heme two-component sensor kinases DosS and DosT and the cognate response regulator DosR) of the bacterial dormancy regulon, a group of about 50 genes with diverse functions (61, 62).\n\nA recently described CO resistance gene (cor) in M.\n\ntuberculosis appears important in dictating the outcome of the host-bacterium battle; the virulence of a cor mutant is attenuated in a mouse model of tuberculosis.\n\nExpression of the Cor protein in E.\n\ncoli is claimed to rescue it from CO toxicity, but the resistance demonstrated was to CORM-2 not CO (63).\n\nThe HO (Hmx1) of the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans and its product, CO, also contribute to pathogenesis (64); mutagenesis of the HMX1 gene results in decreased virulence in murine candidiasis, whereas exposure of mice to therapeutic levels of CO increases C.\n\nalbicans virulence.\n\nInhaled CO partially reverses the virulence defect of the null strain, and so the data are consistent with CO-mediated suppression of acute host inflammatory responses (64).\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section Heme Oxygenases of Mammalian Cells: Implications for Infection Mice deficient in HO-1 are susceptible to oxidant-induced tissue injury, but administration of CO to animals exposed to endotoxin decreases inflammation.\n\nHO-1- or CORM-2-derived CO rescues mice from lethal endotoxemia and sepsis (65).\n\nHowever, the role of CO in tackling a pathogen is less clear (66, 67).\n\nIndeed, suppression of inflammation might compromise the immune system.\n\nOtterbein et al.\n\n(68) showed that CO gas enhances phagocytosis, and Chung et al.\n\n(69) showed that CO derived from HO-1 enhanced the host defense response to polymicrobial sepsis in mice and contributed to bacterial clearing by stimulating phagocytosis.\n\nEnterohemorrhagic E.\n\ncoli (EHEC) stimulate the rapid inducible expression of the human enterocyte HMOX-1 gene that encodes HO-1, and its activity is a critical modulator of the innate immune response (70).\n\nBecause HO-1 activity inhibits iNOS induction, EHEC effectively suppresses NO generation, and thus host antimicrobial activity.\n\nThe CO donor CORM-2 also inhibited iNOS mRNA expression, thus identifying CO, not bilirubin (another product of HO-1 activity), as the effective species (but see caveats below regarding the non-equivalence of CORMs and CO).\n\nUp-regulation of HO-1 was shown to offer protection in mice against infection by Mycobacterium avium or M.\n\ntuberculosis, whereas HO-deficient mice were more susceptible (71).\n\nThus, HO-1 may be an important cytoprotective protein in sepsis and inflammation.\n\nCO is also implicated in the pathogenesis of Clostridium difficile.\n\nInhibition of host HO activity by administering Zn protoporphyrin IX to mice exacerbated the histopathological alterations elicited by C.\n\ndifficile toxin A; conversely, pretreatment of mice with a CO donor (dimanganese decacarbonyl) reduced the effect (60).\n\nIn a recent study, enteric microbiota isolated from pathogen-free mice induced production of HO-1 in colons of wild-type mice but not in colitis-prone interleukin (Il)10\u2212/\u2212 animals (72).\n\nHowever, pharmacological induction of HO-1 by Co(III) protoporphyrin IX chloride protects interleukin\u2212 mice from microbiota (Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium)-induced colitis.\n\nMoreover, HO-derived CO reduced the numbers of live bacteria recovered from various organs, whereas knockdown of HO-1 in macrophages impaired bactericidal activity.\n\nThus, HO-1 and CO ameliorate intestinal inflammation through promotion of bacterial clearance, in part explained by promoting bactericidal activities of macrophages (72, 73).\n\nRecently, Wegiel et al.\n\n(14) have proposed that ATP, acting as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern, which is recognized by innate immune cells, is released from viable bacteria in the presence of CO and triggers activation of the macrophage, inflammasome.\n\nand IL-1\u03b2 secretion.\n\nCuriously, it is suggested that an oxidase binds CO \u201cto compel ATP generation much like that observed in the ATP synthase mutant\u201d (14).\n\nHowever, Gram-negative bacteria are not known to possess periplasmic ATP or to have mechanisms for secretion, so the observed effect is poorly understood.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section The Antimicrobial Effects of CO and CORMs in Vitro and in Vivo In many respects, CO is an attractive candidate for an antimicrobial molecule; it is rarely metabolized and \u201cstable,\u201d is adequately water-soluble, traverses cell membranes (5), and is a molecule that is naturally generated in mammals, plants, and certain microorganisms by HO (supplemental Table 1).\n\nThere is a rapidly growing literature on the diverse antimicrobial effects of CORMs on bacteria (Fig.\n\n1).\n\nNobre et al.\n\n(16) first described the use of CORMs as antimicrobial agents.\n\nCORM-2 and CORM-3 and compounds from Alfama, Inc.\n\n(ALF021, bromo(pentacarbonyl)manganese, and ALF062, tetraethylammonium molybdenum pentacarbonyl bromide) (Table 1) were tested against laboratory strains of E.\n\ncoli and Staphylococcus aureus (16).\n\nFor example, killing of greater than 20% was achieved within 1 h with 250 \u03bcm CORM-2, and more variable killing was achieved with 400 \u03bcm CORM-3.\n\nControl experiments with hemoglobin to sequester CO and the use of inactive forms of the CORMs or solvent-only controls suggested that CO release was the major cause of killing, yet a flux of CO gas (\u223c1 mm dissolved concentration) was markedly less effective than the CORMs. Interestingly, CO was not detected in media to which the CORMs were added, implying that CO release occurs only intracellularly or that the CO liberated extracellularly escapes from the culture.\n\nView larger version: In this window In a new window Download as PowerPoint Slide FIGURE 1.\n\nSites of action and cellular consequences of bacterial exposure to CO and CORMs. Outcomes are generalized and pooled from the reported effects of various metal carbonyl compounds (for details, see the text).\n\nThe bacterial inner membrane (IM) is shown together with the outer membrane (OM) and periplasm (P) at the top only.\n\nThe OM is considered freely permeable to CORMs; transport events are therefore shown through the IM only.\n\n1, CORMs enter bacteria by unknown pathways and driving forces; CO enters by diffusion down concentration gradients.\n\nCORMs may in principle be exported.\n\n2, CORM releases CO intracellularly, leaving a metal-coligand fragment or iCORM.\n\n3, transcription factors (TFs) sense CO, CORM, and iCORM, leading to global transcriptional effects and modified protein profiles.\n\n4, TFs are also activated by ROS that may be generated directly by cellular CORM chemistry or from leakage of reducing equivalents from respiratory chains.\n\n5, a typical simplified bacterial aerobic respiratory chain is shown comprising a flavin-containing NADH dehydrogenase, a ubiquinone (Q) pool, and a terminal heme-containing quinol oxidase.\n\n6, CO binds to the oxidase active site, competing with oxygen and blocking respiration.\n\n7, ATP generation via ATP synthase is compromised.\n\n8, CO (or CORM, not shown) may directly or indirectly interact with IM transporters.\n\n9, diverse cellular responses to CO and CORM exposure are reported.\n\nFour outstanding areas of uncertainty are highlighted (question marks): transport of CORMs into (or out of) cells; intracellular mechanisms of CO liberation from CORMs; modification of TF function and gene expression by CORMs; and effects of CO and CORMs on membrane transporters.\n\nThree important studies indicate the potential for CORM-elicited antimicrobial effects in animal models.\n\nChung et al.\n\n(69) showed that CO from HO-1 enhanced the response to sepsis in mice and stimulated phagocytosis, an effect mimicked by injection of CORM-2.\n\nSecond, CORM-2 and CORM-3 were effective in protecting immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice when injected following Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced bacteremia (20), but CORM-371 was not (22).\n\nThe data suggest a direct bactericidal action rather than stimulation of phagocytosis.\n\nThird, activity of ALF492 (tricarbonyldichloro(thiogalactopyranoside)Ru(II)) (Table 1) was demonstrated (17) in mice against the protozoan parasite Plasmodium falciparum; the injected compound protected mice against experimental cerebral malaria and acute lung injury without formation of carbonmonoxyhemoglobin.\n\nThe protective effect was CO-dependent, and the CORM elicited expression of HO-1, thus amplifying the protection.\n\nALF492 was also shown to be an adjuvant to the established antimalarial compound artesunate (17).\n\nHowever, most recent studies have used in vitro methods and cast doubt on our understanding of the fundamental modes of action, especially the suggestion that CORMs exert antimicrobial activities solely through CO release.\n\nSeveral authors have reported that CORMs are more effective antimicrobial agents than is CO (16, 21).\n\nFor example, 100 \u03bcm CORM-3 was effective against P.\n\naeruginosa in vitro (20), but CO gas (\u223c860 \u03bcm) was not.\n\nImportantly, even 10 \u03bcm CORM-3 was effective against antibiotic-resistant clinical isolates but was not inhibitory to macrophage survival.\n\nRecently, CORMs that release CO only on illumination have been developed and tested as antimicrobial agents.\n\nThe first such study describes a manganese CORM (Table 1) that acts as a stable prodrug in the dark, whereas 365 nm illumination leads to CO release to myoglobin (25).\n\nOnly after irradiation is the compound toxic to E.\n\ncoli, in which CO-ligated terminal oxidases can be detected following internalization of the compound.\n\nThis compound has the advantage of a well defined inactivated form of CORM (iCORM) (25).\n\nSimilarly, a tryptophan-derived manganese-containing complex (tryptoCORM) that releases 1.4 mol of CO on irradiation at 465 nm, and 2 mol at 400 nm, is toxic to E.\n\ncoli but not to macrophages (26).\n\nConcerns over the inexorable spread of antibiotic resistance and the paucity of new antimicrobial drugs have led to studies not only of CORMs as antimicrobials in their own right against antibiotic-resistant clinical isolates (20, 74), but also as adjuvants to established antibiotics, a common practice in clinical therapy (i.e. combination therapy) (supplemental Fig.\n\n1).\n\nIn one study, sub-lethal doses of CORM-2 were combined with metronidazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin and found to potentiate antibiotic effects on clinical isolates of H.\n\npylori (75).\n\nTwo mechanisms of action were reported: inhibition of respiration and of urease activity.\n\nCORM-2 decreased the measured minimal inhibitory and minimal bactericidal concentrations for all antibiotics.\n\nSimilarly, CORM-2 acts as an adjuvant to tobramycin against P.\n\naeruginosa biofilms (76).\n\nIn neither of these studies was it reported whether the effects of CORM-2 and antibiotics together were truly synergistic or merely additive, as assessed by standard fractional inhibitory concentrations (77).\n\nHowever, these potentiating effects observed with CORMs have not been reported to our knowledge with CO gas, although NO and H2S have been shown to confer some defense against antibiotics (78).\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section Transcriptomic and Global Impacts of CORMs Transcriptomic approaches have been highly informative and emphasized the complexity of the CORM response.\n\nIn the first study (21), batch cultures of E.\n\ncoli were used to explore exposure to sub-inhibitory (30\u2013100 \u03bcm) concentrations of CORM-3, aerobically and anaerobically.\n\nThe down-regulation of operons encoding key respiratory complexes (cytochrome bo\u2032 and several dehydrogenases) was striking.\n\nInterestingly, the cydAB genes encoding cytochrome bd-I, an inhibitor-resistant terminal oxidase with a high oxygen affinity, were slightly up-regulated.\n\nThe genes most highly up-regulated were involved in metal homeostasis, especially spy, which encoded a periplasmic stress-response chaperone.\n\nProbabilistic modeling of the comprehensive datasets (21) identified global transcription factors that are potential CO targets or sensors, notably the respiratory metabolism regulators ArcA and Fnr.\n\nHowever, a similar study using 250 \u03bcm CORM-2 (partly bactericidal within 30 min (16)) revealed (79) a gene set with few similarities to the CORM-3 study, but up-regulation of spy and down-regulation of some respiratory operons were observed.\n\nA more rigorous and reproducible approach to transcriptomics is provided by chemostat (continuous) culture in which all growth conditions, including growth rate, are maintained over long periods, thus avoiding growth rate-dependent changes in gene expression (80).\n\nMclean et al.\n\n(81) used not only CORM-3 but also the inactivated iCORM-3 (from which negligible CO release can be shown) to dissect the effects of CO release and other consequences of the E.\n\ncoli response in a chemostat.\n\nTranscriptomics revealed that the response to iCORM-3 is lower than to CORM-3, but that numerous processes are affected by both compounds, including energy metabolism, membrane transport, motility, and the metabolism of sulfur-containing species, including cysteine and methionine.\n\nThere is controversy regarding the roles of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidants in the antibacterial effectiveness of CORMs; the evidence in favor is given in Ref.\n\n59.\n\nIt is established that inhibition of bacterial oxidase activity by CO can lead to higher ROS levels (82), for example from exposed flavins in NADH dehydrogenase (83).\n\nHowever, Tavares et al.\n\n(84) propose the direct involvement of ROS in the toxicity of CORM-2 and ALF062 to E.\n\ncoli; both promote the production of reactive oxygen species, an effect blocked by antioxidants.\n\nMutations in superoxide dismutase or catalase exacerbated CORM toxicity, and CORM-2 induced expression of the DNA repair/SOS system recA and raised levels of free iron in cells.\n\nIn contrast, treatment of P.\n\naeruginosa with three CORMs did not change ROS production (22).\n\nCertain antioxidants (N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and ascorbic acid) suppress H2O2 levels, and NAC, cysteine, and reduced (but not oxidized) glutathione reverse CORM-3-mediated inhibition of bacterial growth and respiration (20, 81).\n\nGlutathione and cysteine also prevented killing of H.\n\npylori by CORM-2, but ROS could not be detected and ascorbic acid did not prevent the antimicrobial effect of CORM-2 (75).\n\nThus, the basis of the effects of these sulfhydryl compounds remains poorly understood but is important because many are intracellular compounds and might promote or modulate CO release in vivo (81).\n\nSignificantly, the effects of antioxidants on CORM toxicity may be linked, not only to counteracting the intracellular toxic effects, but also to the uptake of the CORM.\n\nJesse et al.\n\n(85) found that NAC, widely used to abrogate CORM effects, not only protected respiration from CORM-2 or CORM-3 but also dramatically reduced (5\u20138-fold) CORM uptake.\n\nThe transcriptomic evidence is contradictory.\n\nMany genes implicated with intracellular redox stress were reported in E.\n\ncoli by some (79) but not all (21) authors.\n\nThe genes spy, spb, metF, and htpX seen by us (21) are described in Ref.\n\n59 as \u201cassociated with the generation of intracellular oxidative stress.\u201d However, the up-regulation of spy (the most dramatically changed gene: 26\u2013100-fold (21), not 3-fold as reported in Ref.\n\n59)) is attributed not exclusively to oxidative stress but to hypochlorite-induced membrane disruption (86).\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section How Significant Is Respiratory Blockade in Determining CORM Effectiveness?\n\nCellular respiration is inhibited by CO gas in vitro and in cells via endogenous HO activity (87, 88).\n\nAlthough reaction of CORM-derived CO with intracellular ferrous hemes has been reported consistently (e.g. Refs.\n\n21, 45, and 82), and functionally distinct oxidases have differential sensitivities to CORMs (85), inhibition of respiration is not the only factor affecting the bactericidal activity of CORMs (22).\n\nCORMs may be toxic under anoxic conditions in the absence of respiration (16, 20, 21).\n\nIndeed, in mitochondria, CORMs may inhibit respiration (87, 89) or not (90\u201392).\n\nThe reported uncoupling of mitochondrial respiration by CORM-3 (deduced from stimulated oxygen consumption rates) (90\u201392) and by CORM-401 in cardiomyocytes (93) is relevant to bacteria because CORM-3 at low doses also stimulates respiration in E.\n\ncoli (94).\n\nHowever, classical uncoupling appears not to be the cause because proton translocation quotients and proton backflow rates are unaffected by CORM-3 (94).\n\nThe stimulatory effects may arise from reaction of CO or CORMs with membrane channels as described in mammalian cells (95\u201397).\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section What Is the Mechanism of CORM Activity against Microorganisms?\n\nWherever an answer to this key question has been sought, investigators have found that bacteria accumulate CORMs (16, 21, 81, 85), that CO is bound to identifiable targets (i.e. heme proteins), and CO causes global changes in gene expression and cell function (Fig.\n\n1).\n\nFurthermore, CO gas (as evidenced from data with HO-derived CO in vivo; see above) also perturbs microbial behavior.\n\nHowever, although CORMs were originally developed for safe and reproducible delivery of CO in mammals, the evidence to hand, summarized above, makes it improbable that CO delivery alone is the sole basis of the antimicrobial effects of CORMs. What evidence supports this bold claim?\n\n(a) Saturating solutions of CO gas barely perturb bacterial growth.\n\n(b) Bacteria demonstrate multiple transcriptomic changes to CORM-3 that cannot be understood in terms of known CO biochemistry.\n\n(c) Bacteria respond to iCORM-3 from which no, or negligible, CO release can be demonstrated in vitro.\n\n(d) Critically, cells lacking all hemes are also inhibited by CORM-3 and reveal multiple transcriptomic changes (101).\n\n(e) Finally, other compounds of Ru are taken up and have antimicrobial properties, although they are not CORMs (e.g. Refs.\n\n1 and 98).\n\nWe have suggested (94) that a CORM functions as a \u201cTrojan Horse,\u201d in which the metal carbonyl is the \u201chorse,\u201d delivering a cargo of toxic CO; it is equally conceivable that the toxic cargo is the metal fragment and that CO potentiates uptake.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section Future Prospects Realizing the future potential for CORMs relies on greater understanding of the modes of action of current CORMs and the development of improved compounds with clinical compatibility, for example by making biocompatible CO carriers (99).\n\nIn the post-antibiotic era, there appears to be potential for adjuvant/combination therapy in which CORMs can minimize usage of established antibiotics or reduce the concentrations needed to treat antibiotic-resistant \u201csuperbugs.\u201d Apart from methodological advances in detecting CO, a \u201cCO-quenching\u201d agent would allow the essential dissection of the antibacterial roles of the CO per se and the CORM; a water-soluble complex has been tested as a CO \u201cstripper\u201d in a rat model (100).\n\nOther areas of focus should be improved iCORMs that can be reproducibly prepared and whose chemistry is understood, a study of the potential for microbes developing resistance to CO or CORMs, and a better understanding of the biological chemistry of non-heme CO targets.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section Acknowledgments We are grateful to our colleagues and especially Brian E.\n\nMann and Thomas

the Toronto Invasive Bacterial Diseases Network are listed in the Acknowledgments.\n\nNext Section Abstract Background.\n\nEstimating the risk of antibiotic resistance is important in selecting empiric antibiotics.\n\nWe asked how the timing, number of courses, and duration of antibiotic therapy in the previous 3 months affected antibiotic resistance in isolates causing invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD).\n\nMethods.\n\nWe conducted prospective surveillance for IPD in Toronto, Canada, from 2002 to 2011.\n\nAntimicrobial susceptibility was measured by broth microdilution.\n\nClinical information, including prior antibiotic use, was collected by chart review and interview with patients and prescribers.\n\nResults.\n\nClinical information and antimicrobial susceptibility were available for 4062 (90%) episodes; 1193 (29%) of episodes were associated with receipt of 1782 antibiotic courses in the prior 3 months.\n\nSelection for antibiotic resistance was class specific.\n\nTime elapsed since most recent antibiotic was inversely associated with resistance (cephalosporins: adjusted odds ratio [OR] per day, 0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], .96\u20131.00; P = .02; macrolides: OR, 0.98; 95% CI, .96\u2013.99; P = .005; penicillins: OR [log(days)], 0.62; 95% CI, .44\u2013.89; P = .009; fluoroquinolones: profile penalized-likelihood OR [log(days)], 0.62; 95% CI, .39\u20131.04; P = .07).\n\nRisk of resistance after exposure declined most rapidly for fluoroquinolones and penicillins and reached baseline in 2\u20133 months.\n\nThe decline in resistance was slowest for macrolides, and in particular for azithromycin.\n\nThere was no significant association between duration of therapy and resistance for any antibiotic class.\n\nToo few patients received multiple courses of the same antibiotic class to assess the significance of repeat courses.\n\nConclusions.\n\nTime elapsed since last exposure to a class of antibiotics is the most important factor predicting antimicrobial resistance in pneumococci.\n\nThe duration of effect is longer for macrolides than other classes.\n\nKey words antibiotic use fluoroquinolone resistance S.\n\npneumoniae Previous SectionNext Section Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of illness and death, with an estimated 43 500 cases and 5000 deaths annually in the United States [1].\n\nEarly adequate antimicrobial therapy is paramount to reducing morbidity and mortality [2, 3].\n\nBecause preexisting resistance to the class of antibiotic chosen for therapy is associated with treatment failure and early treatment improves outcomes in severe infections, the ability to predict the likelihood of antimicrobial resistance at presentation in individual patients is crucial to the optimal choice of empiric antimicrobial therapy [4, 5].\n\nNumerous studies have demonstrated the association between antimicrobial resistance and prior antibiotic use [6\u201310].\n\nAlthough it is often inferred in clinical practice, the relative importance of cumulative duration of prior antibiotic therapy, number of treatment courses, and time between antibiotic exposure and infection remains unclear [11].\n\nInsights into the clinical significance of these variables are of value to clinicians in identifying those patients with previous antibiotic exposure who are at highest risk for infection with a resistant strain of S.\n\npneumoniae.\n\nThe objectives of this study were to determine the extent to which cumulative prior antibiotic exposure, number of treatment courses, and timing of prior antibiotic treatment predict antimicrobial resistance in isolates of S.\n\npneumoniae causing invasive disease.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section MATERIALS AND METHODS Population-Based Surveillance for Invasive Pneumococcal Infections The Toronto Invasive Bacterial Diseases Network (TIBDN) is a collaboration of all hospitals, microbiology laboratories, infection control practitioners, physicians, and public health units serving the population of metropolitan Toronto and the Regional Municipality of Peel (population 4.1 million in 2012) that performs population-based surveillance for selected serious bacterial and viral infections [4, 8, 12].\n\nAll 25 hospitals, 19 laboratories, and 85 long-term-care facilities serving residents of the population area participate in this network.\n\nAll invasive pneumococcal infections identified by participating laboratories from 1 January 2002 through 31 December 2011 were included in the analyses.\n\nInvasive pneumococcal infection was defined as illness in which S.\n\npneumoniae was isolated from a normally sterile body site.\n\nIsolates were forwarded to the central laboratory at Mount Sinai Hospital and informed consent was obtained to collect detailed clinical data (including recent antibiotic exposure).\n\nAnnual audits were conducted in each laboratory to ensure completeness of reporting.\n\nFor the assessment of 30-day mortality, patients who were cured or improving at discharge before 30 days and not readmitted to the same hospital were assumed to have survived.\n\nUnderlying conditions predisposing to invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) were defined as per the Canadian National Advisory Committee on Immunization [13].\n\nHealthcare-associated infections were defined as those not present or incubating on admission [14].\n\nPrevious Antibiotic Exposure We obtained a history of antibiotics received in the 3 months prior to the date of positive culture from patients and/or their next of kin, family physicians, other physicians identified as relevant by patients, and reviews of hospital and emergency department charts.\n\nInformation obtained included the clinical indication for the antibiotic course, antibiotic name, and start and end dates of antibiotic therapy.\n\nAntibiotic exposure was included in analyses if reported by any 1 source.\n\nIf the same antibiotic was reported by both a physician and a patient, with start dates within 1 week, a single course was assumed using the physician's reported dates.\n\nWhere duration of therapy was unavailable, a 5-day course was assumed for azithromycin and a 7-day course for all other antibiotics.\n\nEpisodes were excluded from class-specific analyses if treatment dates were unavailable for the respective class of antibiotics or if antibiotic class was unknown for any reported course.\n\nOnly the first episode per individual was included in class-specific analyses.\n\nThe antibiotics must have been prescribed on an earlier healthcare visit than that at which the culture was obtained.\n\nA course of antibiotic was defined as receipt of antibiotics of the same class for an uninterrupted period.\n\nAntibiotic exposure was classified as follows: Prior: if the antibiotics were prescribed for a different clinical episode of infection.\n\nRelapse: if a patient received a course of antibiotics for an illness with the same diagnosis as the current episode of pneumococcal infection and the last dose was taken >48 hours and <14 days prior to the culture yielding S.\n\npneumoniae.\n\nFailure: if a patient was receiving antibiotics (defined as most recent dose <48 hours previously) for the current episode of infection when the culture yielding S.\n\npneumoniae was obtained.\n\nLaboratory Analysis Isolates were sent to the central TIBDN laboratory at Mount Sinai Hospital (Toronto, Canada), where they were confirmed as S.\n\npneumoniae by standard methodology, including colonial morphology on blood agar, bile solubility, susceptibility to Optochin, and AccuProbe (Gen-Probe, San Diego, California).\n\nAntimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using broth microdilution in accordance with Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines [15].\n\nEuropean Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) breakpoints were used for a secondary analysis assessing ciprofloxacin resistance [16].\n\nSerotyping of isolates was performed at the central study laboratory and the National Centre for Streptococcus in Edmonton, Alberta/Winnipeg, Manitoba, according to standard methodology [17].\n\nFor these analyses, we defined erythromycin, penicillin, and levofloxacin resistance and ceftriaxone nonsusceptibility in accordance with CLSI guidelines (using meningitis breakpoints for penicillin and ceftriaxone), and fluoroquinolone nonsusceptibility as a ciprofloxacin minimum inhibitory concentration \u22654 mg/L.\n\nStatistical Analysis Data were double-entered and cleaned, then manually inspected for errors and outlying values, which were confirmed or corrected with original records.\n\nDifferences in medians were analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.\n\nData were analyzed using SAS software version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina) and are presented as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).\n\nTwo-sided P values \u2264.05 were considered statistically significant.\n\nAntibiotic class-specific logistic regression models were used to assess the impact of time from end of antibiotic therapy, total duration of antibiotic therapy, and number of antibiotic courses on antibiotic resistance in infecting isolates (due to rare events, for fluoroquinolones, the Firth penalized-likelihood method and profile-likelihood CIs were used).\n\nLinearity was evaluated graphically and variables were log-transformed if transformation improved linearity in the logit.\n\nWe evaluated potential confounders if they were known from previous reports to be associated with resistance to particular antibiotic classes (macrolides: year, age, and human immunodeficiency virus infection; fluoroquinolones: year, immunosuppressive therapy, and hospital or nursing home associated; penicillins: year, age, underlying chronic condition, alcoholism, and hospital or nursing home associated; cephalosporins: year) and were significantly associated with resistance (P \u2264 .05) in bivariate analyses in our dataset.\n\nPotential confounding by serotype was evaluated in all categories by grouping together 13-valent and 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine serotypes.\n\nPotential confounders were discarded if inclusion increased CIs and did not change primary effect estimates.\n\nBecause failure of antimicrobial therapy and relapse may be associated with preexisting antibiotic resistance in the infecting isolate, the primary analysis of impact of prior antibiotic therapy was conducted excluding relapsing patients and patients failing antimicrobial therapy.\n\nSecondary analyses were conducted including all episodes with antibiotic exposure, including episodes classified as relapses but not those classified as failures, and excluding antibiotic courses whose length was imputed.\n\nLikelihood ratio tests of nested models were conducted in SAS using the %VUONG macro [18].\n\nProfile penalized-likelihood P values were calculated in SAS using the %FL macro [19].\n\nEthics Approval The study was approved by the research ethics boards at all participating institutions.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section RESULTS During the 10-year period, 4490 episodes of IPD were identified.\n\nIn children <5 years of age, the incidence of IPD decreased from 34.5 cases per 100 000 in 2002 to 12.4 cases per 100 000 in 2011.\n\nAmong adults aged \u226565 years, incidence decreased from 2002 to 2005 and then remained stable from 2005 to 2011 (19.9 cases per 100 000 in 2011).\n\nIn other age groups, the incidence of disease remained stable during the study period, averaging 2.7 cases per 100 000 among children aged 5\u201314 years and 4.4 cases per 100 000 in adults aged 15\u201364 years [20].\n\nDetailed clinical information and antimicrobial susceptibility data were available for 4062 (90%) episodes.\n\nMedian age of patients was 57 years (range, 0\u2013108 years), and 45% (1814/4062) were female.\n\nOverall, patients in 31% of episodes (1273/4062) had an immunocompromising condition or were receiving immunosuppressive therapy, and 49% (1990/4062) had a nonimmunocompromising condition associated with increased risk for IPD.\n\nInfection was hospital acquired in 178 of 4062 (4%) episodes and nursing home acquired in 203 of 4062 (5%) episodes.\n\nPatients in 88% (3580/4059) of episodes were hospitalized, and 28% (1127/4059) required intensive care unit admission.\n\nAmong those requiring hospitalization, the 30-day in-hospital mortality rate was 17% (620/3580).\n\nOverall, 21% (845/4062) of isolates were erythromycin resistant, 1% (52/4062) were nonsusceptible to fluoroquinolones (of which 32 [62%] were resistant to levofloxacin), 16% (657/4062) were penicillin resistant, and 6% (243/4062) were nonsusceptible to ceftriaxone.\n\nBetween 2002 and 2011, resistance to erythromycin increased from 14% to 32% (P < .0001), and resistance to penicillin increased from 15% to 17% (P = .0003), whereas resistance to levofloxacin remained stable.\n\nFigure 1 presents the distribution of IPD episodes according to antibiotic exposure in the prior 3 months.\n\nOverall, 1193 (29%) episodes were associated with 1782 prior antibiotic courses (median, 1 [range, 1\u201313]).\n\nThese included macrolides (349 courses), fluoroquinolones (436 courses), penicillins (322 courses), cephalosporins (311 courses), other antibiotic classes (292 courses), and 72 courses in which the antibiotic class could not be identified.\n\nThe 70 (2%) episodes associated with these latter 72 courses were excluded from analyses.\n\nDates of treatment were unavailable for 234 of 1405 (17%) of the remaining macrolide, fluoroquinolone, penicillin, and cephalosporin courses, and the associated episodes were excluded from respective antibiotic exposure analyses.\n\nDuration of treatment was imputed for 245 of 1405 (17%) macrolide, fluoroquinolone, penicillin, or cephalosporin courses.\n\nThe relationships between categories of prior antibiotic exposure and resistance in the infecting isolate are shown in Figure

surveillance of IPD, we were able to confirm the association between prior antibiotic use and pneumococcal resistance.\n\nOur results suggest that the time elapsed from most recent treatment and new infection is much more important than cumulative prior antibiotic exposure.\n\nFor penicillins, cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolones, resistance declines rapidly in the first month after antibiotic exposure, and by 60\u201390 days after the last dose of antibiotics, the probability of resistance has returned to baseline population levels.\n\nFor macrolides, the decline in resistance appears to be slower and more continuous.\n\nAlthough a few prospective studies have examined the relationship between the details of antibiotic exposure and resistance development [21\u201323], differentiating particular factors related to prior antimicrobial exposure and the development of resistance has been challenging.\n\nA recent systematic review by Costelloe et al was unable to detect any studies that compared the effects of timing of antibiotic treatment, duration of therapy, and number of courses of antibiotics and resistance in pneumococci [11].\n\nIn addition, none of the identified studies assessed time from the end of antibiotic therapy as a continuous variable [11].\n\nGuillemot et al, in a study of penicillin resistance in 55 nasopharyngeal isolates of pneumococci in 54 children, only identified resistance in children who had received longer courses and lower doses of antibiotics in the 30 days prior to culture, but the differences between longer and shorter duration and higher and lower doses of antibiotics were not statistically significant [24].\n\nIn a retrospective cohort study of factors associated with penicillin resistance in 303 pediatric and adult patients with pneumococcal bacteremia, Ruhe and Hasbun found that longer exposure to \u03b2-lactams and >1\u20132 courses of \u03b2-lactams, sulfonamides, and macrolides were associated with penicillin nonsusceptibility in pneumococcal isolates [25].\n\nNeither of these studies assessed time from last antibiotic exposure, and neither had adequate power to permit multivariable analysis.\n\nIn studies of bacterial species other than pneumococci, Costelloe et al found that longer duration and multiple courses of antibiotic exposure were generally associated with higher rates of antibiotic resistance, but results were not consistent [23, 26, 27].\n\nThe prospective study by Malhotra-Kumar et al demonstrated that azithromycin and clarithromycin resistance in oral streptococci appear to decrease with time from antibiotic exposure over a >6-month period [21], with clarithromycin resistance rates declining more rapidly.\n\nIn contrast, the study on the effect of amoxicillin exposure on resistance rates in Haemophilus influenzae by Chung et al showed that resistance rates decrease to near baseline within 12 weeks [22].\n\nIn another study of amoxicillin and urinary tract infections due to Escherichia coli, Hillier et al found that longer duration, lower dose, and time from most recent antibiotic exposure were all associated with amoxicillin resistance, with resistance returning to baseline within 1\u20133 months [27].\n\nThese studies suggest that decay in resistance risk after exposure to antibiotics may depend on the particular antibiotic\u2013bacterial species combination being studied.\n\nOur results indicate that, for antibiotics other than macrolides, baseline resistance rates can be expected after 90 days from last antibiotic exposure in S.\n\npneumoniae.\n\nAfter exposure to macrolides, particularly azithromycin, resistance rates decrease more slowly.\n\nThis may be explained by the longer plasma half-life of azithromycin (>60 hours compared with 5\u20137 hours for clarithromycin, 7 hours for levofloxacin, or 70 minutes for amoxicillin), leading to prolonged subtherapeutic concentrations of azithromycin and ongoing selection of resistant bacterial strains for >3 weeks after treatment [21, 28\u201331].\n\nThat time from end of antibiotic treatment plays a role in predicting antibiotic resistance seems obvious in that the antibiotic-susceptible bacterial population surviving antibiotic treatment (so-called persister cells) requires time to repopulate mucosal surfaces and outnumber resistant strains with a growth disadvantage due to fitness costs of maintaining mechanisms of resistance [32].\n\nSimilarly, the relatively consistent trend toward additional antibiotic courses being associated with increased risk of resistance is logical, although it is important to note that few patients received multiple courses of the same antibiotic, and the confidence limits on the estimate of the effect of numbers of courses are wide.\n\nLess intuitively, we were unable to identify any association between total duration of antibiotic exposure and risk of resistance.\n\nThe apparent discrepancy between the effect of number of courses and duration of therapy may occur because multiple rounds of exposure results in more effective selection for drug-resistant strains than a single, more prolonged exposure.\n\nHowever, as mentioned before, it is also possible that, despite excluding antibiotic failures and relapses, our findings are affected by artifacts of sampling.\n\nOur study has several limitations.\n\nSampling from 10 years in a single geographic area may limit the generalizability of our results to other settings.\n\nAs discussed above, our results apply to S.\n\npneumoniae and prior antibiotic exposure to macrolides, fluoroquinolones, penicillins, and cephalosporins and may not translate to other bacterial species\u2013antibiotic combinations.\n\nWe were not able to assess the role of antibiotic dose on development of resistance [33].\n\nAntibiotic resistance rates change over time, as demonstrated for macrolide resistance in our data set.\n\nAlthough our multivariable models found that this did not affect the association between time from end of antibiotic exposure and bacterial resistance, this may not be true in all circumstances [21], and relationships may differ if mechanisms of resistance differ over time, or as the introduction of pneumococcal vaccination programs changes the serotype distribution of pneumococcal infections.\n\nFinally, antibiotic exposures were as defined by patients' reporting having taken them and/or physicians' reporting having written a prescription; however, not all prescriptions may have been filled, patients' recall may be subject to bias, and we did not assess compliance with taking antibiotics.\n\nIn conclusion, in patients previously exposed to antibiotics who subsequently develop pneumococcal disease, the time elapsed from the last treatment course is of considerable value in predicting antimicrobial resistance and the number of courses may be of value, but cumulative antibiotic exposure is not helpful.\n\nClinicians' choices of empirical antibiotic therapy for presumptive pneumococcal infections should ideally take into account the shape of declining resistance over time.\n\nFurther research is needed to define relationships in other bacterial species\u2013antibiotic combinations.\n\nIncreasing the precision and detail in information collected about antibiotic exposure in studies of antibiotic resistance may help to improve clinician decision making about empiric antibiotic choices in the future.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section Notes Acknowledgments.\n\nOther investigators in

Introduction We aimed to compare intensive care unit mortality due to non-pneumococcal severe community-acquired pneumonia between the periods 2000\u20132002 and 2008\u20132014, and the impact of the improvement in antibiotic strategies on outcomes.\n\nMethods This was a matched case\u2013control study enrolling 144 patients with non-pneumococcal severe pneumonia: 72 patients from the 2000\u20132002 database (CAPUCI I group) were paired with 72 from the 2008\u20132014 period (CAPUCI II group), matched by the following variables: microorganism, shock at admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, immunocompromise, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and age over 65 years.\n\nResults The most frequent microorganism was methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (22.1 %) followed by Legionella pneumophila and Haemophilus influenzae (each 20.7 %); prevalence of shock was 59.7 %, while 73.6 % of patients needed invasive mechanical ventilation.\n\nIntensive care unit mortality was significantly lower in the CAPUCI II group (34.7 % versus 16.7 %; odds ratio (OR) 0.78, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.64\u20130.95; p = 0.02).\n\nAppropriate therapy according to microorganism was 91.5 % in CAPUCI I and 92.7 % in CAPUCI II, while combined therapy and early antibiotic treatment were significantly higher in CAPUCI II (76.4 versus 90.3 % and 37.5 versus 63.9 %; p < 0.05).\n\nIn the multivariate analysis, combined antibiotic therapy (OR 0.23, 95 % CI 0.07\u20130.74) and early antibiotic treatment (OR 0.07, 95 % CI 0.02\u20130.22) were independently associated with decreased intensive care unit mortality.\n\nConclusions In non-pneumococcal severe community-acquired pneumonia , early antibiotic administration and use of combined antibiotic therapy were both associated with increased intensive care unit survival during the study period.\n\nIntroductionIn Western countries, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the leading cause of death and is associated with high healthcare costs [1].\n\nIn the intensive care unit (ICU) setting, it is one of the most common reasons for admission and the most frequent causes of mortality [2].\n\nAntibiotic treatment is the cornerstone for management of pneumonia, and adequate empiric treatment is associated with improved outcomes [1].The trend in CAP mortality over recent decades remains unclear, despite many efforts to identify it.\n\nContrasting results have been obtained in different publications because most of them did not differentiate between outpatients, patients admitted to the ward and patients admitted to the ICU [3, 4].\n\nConversely, many recently published studies have found a significant decrease in mortality in septic shock [5\u20137], or in severe respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) [8]; therefore, it is reasonable to assume that mortality due to severe pneumonia, especially when complicated with septic shock, may have decreased in the last few years.\n\nIn a recent study, we found a reduction in mortality due to pneumococcal severe (S)CAP and an association between better management of antibiotic therapy and improved ICU survival [9].The present study hypothesizes that, as in pneumococcal SCAP [9], an improvement in antibiotic policies will contribute to reducing mortality in non-pneumococcal SCAP.\n\nThe primary objective was to determine ICU mortality due to non-pneumococcal SCAP, and the secondary objective was to assess whether improvements in antibiotic prescription had been implemented.\n\nMaterials and methodsThis was a matched case\u2013control study enrolling 144 ICU patients diagnosed with non-pneumococcal SCAP: 72 patients from the CAPUCI I study (2000\u20132002 period) were paired with 72 patients from the CAPUCI II database (2008\u20132014 period).CAPUCI I was a multicenter, prospective, observational study carried out in 33 hospitals in Spain between 2000 and 2002.\n\nAll patients admitted to ICU with diagnosis of SCAP were included.\n\nCAPUCI II was a follow-up project endorsed by the European Critical Care Research Network, carried out in 29 European ICUs from 2008 to 2014.\n\nIn both studies, patients were admitted to the ICU either to undergo IMV or because they were in an unstable clinical condition [1].\n\nAll cases were followed until ICU discharge or death, and all clinical decisions were left to the discretion of the attending physician.\n\nData from these cohorts have been reported elsewhere [10].\n\nThe Joan XXIII University Hospital Ethics Board (coordinating centre) approved the study (REF 2005/NA); the need for informed consent was waived due to the observational nature of the studies.Pneumonia was diagnosed when a patient had consistent clinical findings plus a new pulmonary infiltrate on chest radiography.\n\nImmunocompromise was defined as primary immunodeficiency or immunodeficiency secondary to radiation treatment, use of cytotoxic drugs or steroids (daily doses >20 mg prednisolone or equivalent for >2 weeks), transplantation or AIDS.\n\nShock was defined as the need for a vasopressor during >4 hours after fluid replacement; rapid radiographic spread was defined as an increase in the size of opacities on chest radiograph >50 % at 48 hours.SCAP was defined as pneumonia that required ICU admission, with single or multi-organ failure.\n\nPatients proceeding from a long-term care facility, diagnosed with healthcare-associated pneumonia and with a no-cardiopulmonary resuscitation indication were not included.\n\nMicrobiological diagnosis required a positive result from a respiratory sample or blood culture, or a positive urinary antigen in the case of Legionella spp.\n\ninfection.\n\nProbability of death was predicted according to the \u201cestimated risk of mortality\u201d using the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score in the CAPUCI I cohort and Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) III in the CAPUCI II cohort [11, 12].\n\nMonotherapy and combined therapy were defined as administration of the same antibiotic (one or more) during the first 2 days of ICU admission.\n\nEarly antibiotic administration was defined as administration of the first dose of antibiotic within 3 hours of hospital admission.Patients with pneumonia and negative cultures, documented viral pneumonia or mixed aerobic/anaerobic flora were excluded; likewise, aspiration pneumonia, often associated with impaired clinical status [13], was excluded from the analysis so as to avoid bias.\n\nTo perform the case\u2013control analysis, each patient from the CAPUCI II group with a confirmed microbial etiology was matched with one from the CAPUCI I group with the same microorganism.\n\nSubsequently, the rest of variables used to match patients were: 1) presence of shock at ICU admission; 2) need for IMV; 3) immunosuppression; 4) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and 5) age (cut-off, 65 years) [14]; all main determinants for mortality in CAP [15, 16].All data management and statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS 20 processor (SPSS inc., Chicago, IL).\n\nResults are expressed as medians and interquartile range for continuous variables, or as absolute percentages for categorical variables.\n\nContinuous variables were compared with the Mann\u2013Whitney U test (non-normally distributed variables).\n\nCategorical variables were assessed with the chi-square or two-tailed Fisher exact test.A multivariate model was performed to identify the variables associates with changes in mortality.\n\nTo construct the model, we performed a logistic regression using all variables from the univariate analysis that were associated with a different mortality as covariates; subsequently, to optimize the model and minimize an overfitting bias, an automatic stepwise backward covariate selection was performed.\n\nThus, multivariate analysis was finally adjusted according to the following variables: shock at admission, acute renal failure, combination therapy and early antibiotic administration.Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to construct survival curves for patients receiving combination and monotherapy regimens and early versus late antibiotic administration.\n\nResultsICU mortality was significantly lower in the CAPUCI II group (34.7 versus 16.7 %; odds ratio (OR) 0.78, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.64\u20130.95; p = 0.02).\n\nFigure 1 shows a flow chart analysis for patient selection; in both CAPUCI I and CAPUCI II populations, mortality among patients enrolled in the analysis was compared with mortality of the rest of patients in the same group, with no significant differences being found (Fig.\n\n1).\n\nIn both cohorts, mortality of patients enrolled in the case\u2013control analysis did not present significant differences when compared with patients not introduced into the analysis.\n\nMortality in the CAPUCI I cohort was 34.7 % in patients enrolled in the analysis versus 33.8 % in non-matched patients with non-pneumococcal pneumonia with confirmed microorganism (p = 1.00); in CAPUCI II, it was 16.7 % in matched and 17.4 % in non-matched patients, respectively (p = 1.00).\n\nFigure 2 depicts survival depending on the microbiological isolate: the most frequent microorganism was Staphylococcus aureus (22.1 %), followed by Legionella pneumophila and Haemophilus influenzae (each 20.7 %).\n\nTable 1 shows the variables used to pair patients; individuals selected for the case\u2013control analysis showed a prevalence of shock and IMV of 59.7 % and 73.6 %, respectively.\n\nFurthermore, Table 1 shows the prevalence of the matching variables in patients with non-pneumococcal bacterial pneumonia not selected for the matching analysis; no significant differences were observed between matched and non-matched patients.\n\nAs indicated in Table 2, estimated probability of death was 32.0 % in the CAPUCI II group and 34.0 % in the CAPUCI I group (p = 0.59).\n\nBacteremia was observed in 22.2 % of CAPUCI I and in 30.6 % of CAPUCI II (p = 0.35).\n\nNo significant differences were observed in length of ICU stay (10.5 versus 12.0 days; p = 0.16) or length of IMV (8.0 versus 10.5 days; p = 0.18).\n\nMortality showed an absolute reduction of 18 % between the CAPUCI II group (34.7 %) and the CAPUCI I group (16.7 %) (p = 0.02).\n\nFigure 3 compares ICU mortality between groups.\n\nIn the CAPUCI II group, it fell significantly in the overall population with an OR of 0.78 (95 % CI 0.64\u20130.95; p = 0.02); in ventilated patients the OR was 0.70 (95 % CI 0.53\u20130.91; p = 0.01) while in patients with shock it was 0.60 (95 % CI 0.43\u20130.84; p < 0.01).\n\nFig.\n\n1 Flow chart diagram of patient selection and mortality in the

Data are presented as n (%).\n\nSignificant p values are indicated in bold.\n\nAB antibiotic, BL beta-lactam, CI confidence interval, COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, FQ fluoroquinolone, ICU intensive care unit, M macrolide, OR odds ratio As shown in Table 7, we explored whether the administration of a specific antibiotic combination was associated with changes in mortality, without observing significant differences.\n\nWe compared mortality after the administration of either beta-lactam-macrolide (univariate analysis: OR 0.72, 95 % CI 0.34\u20131.54) or beta-lactam-quinolone (univariate analysis: OR 0.43, 95 % CI 0.17\u20131.14) regimens, without observing significant differences (data not shown).Variables from the univariate analysis that were associated with significant changes in mortality were introduced in a multivariate model analysis.\n\nAcute kidney injury and shock at ICU admission were associated with a higher risk of ICU mortality (OR 4.56, 95 % CI 1.60\u201313.02; and OR 3.96, 95 % CI 1.29\u201312.14, respectively.\n\nConversely, early antibiotic treatment (OR 0.07, 95 % CI 0.02\u20130.22) and combined therapy (OR 0.23, 95 % CI 0.07\u20130.74) were associated with a lower risk of mortality during ICU admission.Furthermore, we explored if the agreement with 2007 Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society (IDSA/ATS) guidelines was associated with an improved outcome, observing a decreased mortality after delivery of adequate treatment (OR 0.65, 95 % CI 0.48\u20130.89).\n\nWhen we performed a multivariate analysis (variable introduced in the model: shock at admission, acute renal failure and 2007 IDSA/ATS agreement) the association was still significantly present (OR 0.39, 95 % CI 0.17\u20130.91).\n\nHowever, the same association was not present when, in the same multivariate model, the variables \u201ccombination therapy\u201d and \u201cearly antibiotic administration\u201d were added (for mortality for the variable \u201c2007 IDSA/ATS agreement: OR 0.98; 95 % CI 0.32\u20132.97).\n\nDiscussionThe most relevant conclusions of the present analysis were the significant decrease in ICU mortality due to non-pneumococcal SCAP between the two cohorts, and the positive association between improved empirical antibiotic treatment and a lower mortality rate.\n\nThese findings confirm our primary hypothesis, and are consistent with the results obtained from our previous study in patients with pneumococcal CAP from the same database [9].Few published studies have assessed changes in mortality due to CAP in recent years.\n\nMoreover, as mentioned above, the vast majority did not differentiate between critical and non-critical patients [3, 4].\n\nHowever, several studies have reported a significant decrease in mortality due to all-source septic shock in recent decades [5\u20137].\n\nOur results were obtained in a population with a high rate of IMV (73.6 %) or secondary shock (59.7 %).\n\nIn this setting, during the planning of a study, we believe that is vital to differentiate between critical and non-critical patients.To our knowledge, no studies to date have assessed mortality due to SCAP with regard to etiology.\n\nIt is worth noting that, during the matching process, we did not set a percentage for each microorganism a priori; instead, we found the number of coincidences between groups according to the above-mentioned variables.\n\nInterestingly, the distribution of the identified microorganisms in our sample coincides with literature reports, thus confirming the study\u2019s external reproducibility [1, 17].As indicated in Table 6, the vast majority of patients received adequate treatment according to microbiology.\n\nAs expected, appropriateness of treatment in case of infection due to Legionella pneumophila and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was lower.\n\nIn case of Legionella infection the treatment was adequate in 86.7 % of patients from the CAPUCI I and II groups.\n\nOn the other hand, treatment was adequate with respect to microbiology respectively in 45.5 and 54.5 % of patients with infection due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\n\nThis is important because an inappropriate treatment can lead to an increased mortality.\n\nIn fact, the survival rate in case of Pseudomonas pneumonia was the lowest when compared with other etiologies (with the exception of Enterobacter infection; however, this is not significant as only four patients were introduced in the analysis, two in each group), and this is probably due to the low rate of adequate empirical treatment.\n\nDespite this, an improvement in mortality was observed between the two periods, and this is probably due to the earlier administration of the first dose of antibiotic and other general improvements that have been made in the last years in the management of ICU patients.When exploring mortality depending on the etiology of pneumonia, we observed an increased survival between the two cohorts when pneumonia was caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes.\n\nNo changes were observed in case of Klebsiella infection, and an increased mortality was observed in case of Legionella pneumonia.\n\nAs shown in Table 3, a higher proportion of patients from CAPUCI II received early combination therapy.\n\nWhen exploring the administration of mono- versus combination therapy, differentiating by the microorganisms, it becomes evident that all cases with the exception of Legionella and Pseudomonas infections received a higher rate of combined therapy if belonging to the CAPUCI II group (Table 6).\n\nThus, it is reasonable to assume that the decrease in mortality in our sample was mainly caused by a higher rate of combination therapy and early antibiotic administration.In the case of pneumonia due to Legionella pneumophila, an increased mortality between the two groups was observed.\n\nFifteen patients with Legionella infection were included in both groups: 3 out of 15 and 5 out 15 died, respectively, in the CAPUCI I and II groups.\n\nAmong those who died, two individuals out of three from the CAPUCI I cohort received microbiological adequate coverture (one received a quinolone regimen while the other a macrolide regimen); in CAPUCI II, they were three out of five (all received a macrolide regimen) (Table 6).\n\nOn the other hand, all patients but one (belonging to the CAPUCI II group) received delayed antibiotic treatment.\n\nWe assume that the small size of the sample, fortuity and probably some unrecognized factor other than antibiotic therapy played a role in the different mortality.\n\nDue to the low number of patients that died because of Legionella infection, it is difficult to ascribe changes in mortality because of the use of quinolones rather than macrolides, although it is not possible to exclude it.In the case of Klebsiella infection, due to the reduced number of cases (four patients for each group, with 50 % mortality in both cohorts), it is not possible to take definitive conclusions.Another important finding is the association between lower mortality and an improvement in antibiotic strategies; that is, combined antibiotic therapy and early treatment initiation.\n\nCombined therapy has become common practice in the empirical treatment of SCAP [1].\n\nTo our knowledge, no current guideline suggests monotherapy as empirical therapy.\n\nGenerally, the recommendation is a beta-lactam plus either a macrolide or a quinolone.\n\nIn the CAPUCI I group, monotherapy was administered in 17 patients (23.6 %) and in 7 patients (9.7 %) in the CAPUCI II group.Univariate and multivariate analysis, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, all showed a positive association between delivery of combined antibiotic therapy and lower mortality.\n\nPrevious studies observed that patients with CAP and secondary shock or bacteremia [18, 19] presented lower mortality when combined therapy was delivered.\n\nOur results confirm these findings and, furthermore, suggest that all patients with severe pneumonia, with or without shock or need for IMV, may benefit from combined therapy.\n\nEven though this may not be a surprising conclusion, it should be noted that a significant percentage of our population and those in other studies still received monotherapy [20].\n\nThese findings are consistent with those reported in patients with pneumococcal SCAP [9].To date, the optimal antibiotic combination choice in severe CAP is still a debated issue; some authors advocate the use of a macrolide-regimen administration, due to the anti-inflammatory effects shown by these molecules [21].\n\nHowever, not all studies achieved similar results.\n\nAlthough in our cohort the limited size of the sample makes it difficult to explore this issue, we assessed changes in mortality after macrolide or quinolone administration, in the whole population (Table 7) and in the subgroups of patients with shock or under mechanical ventilation (data not shown)\u2014no differences were observed.\n\nFurthermore, several studies concluded that quinolone administration is comparable in terms of mortality with a macrolide regimen, but with a higher eradication rate, a lower treatment failure and possibly less cost of treatment [22]; however, concerns about an increased resistance rate after quinolone administration were raised [23].\n\nMoreover, in case of a social environment with high rates of pulmonary tuberculosis, the use of a fluoroquinolone could mask a pulmonary tuberculosis rather than bacterial CAP [24].\n\nIn our sample, the use of a quinolone regimen showed a trend to lower mortality, without achieving significant results, in the whole population and in the subgroups of patients with shock or under mechanical ventilation.\n\nAccording to the present results, it is not possible to advocate the use of a specific antibiotic family.In 2006, Kumar et al.\n\nshowed that mortality rates in septic patients with shock increased in line with the delay in antibiotic initiation [25].\n\nSubsequent other studies of patients with shock confirmed this finding [26].\n\nAs shown in the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (Fig.\n\n5), early antibiotic treatment in our sample was associated with lower mortality not only in the subgroup of patients with shock, but in the overall population and in the subgroup of ventilated patients as well.\n\nIn view of these findings, each patient who presents at the emergency room with non-pneumococcal SCAP should receive the first dose of antibiotic treatment within the first 3 hours.\n\nIndeed, the 2007 IDSA/ATS guidelines recommend initiation of antibiotic therapy before transfer to the ward or to the ICU [1].We explored if the agreement with the 2007 IDSA/ATS guidelines was associated with different outcomes, and we found a reduced mortality when guideline recommendations were followed.\n\nBasically, IDSA/ATS guidelines recommend the administration of an early combination of specific antibiotic families; thus, to better investigate the effects of simple medical actions on mortality, we decided to separate the item \u201c2007 IDSA/ATS adequate treatment\u201d into two variables: \u201ccombined therapy\u201d and \u201cearly antibiotic treatment\u201d.\n\nThus, after the addition of these two variables in the multivariate model this association was no longer documented.\n\nThis might suggest that the sum of actions that imply the agreement to international guidelines is better investigated by separating these actions in multiple variables rather that grouping all actions into the variable \u201c2007 IDSA/ATS adequate treatment\u201d.The current study has some limitations that should be mentioned.\n\nThe most important is its observational nature; however, this approach is the only way to assess changes in outcome over a period of time.\n\nMoreover, in the ICU setting in recent decades there have been significant improvements in the management of patients undergoing IMV or resuscitation of septic shock, and in nutrition, in the prevention of ICU-related complications and in the ICU admission criteria as well.\n\nSeverity-of-illness was recorded with different scores; in CAPUCI I the risk of mortality was estimated using APACHE II score while in CAPUCI II SAPS III was used.\n\nHowever, both scales reflect a reliable risk of death and were widely validated in large-scale studies.\n\nFor this, after estimating the risk of death with APACHE II and SAPS III scores, we created a variable named \u201cestimated probability of death\u201d, comparing both groups.\n\nFurthermore, to avoid an overlap between the same parameters in different variables, we decided not to use severity-score variables to match patients; in fact, both APACHE II and SAPS III scores include parameters of severity for respiratory or cardiac failure, and demographics such as age, which were introduced independently in the matching.\n\nOf note, the ICUs that participated in CAPUCI I and II studies were different; in fact, CAPUCI I was developed in 33 Spanish ICUs while CAPUCI II was carried out in 29 ICUs\u201324 from Spain and 5 from other European countries.\n\nThis may originate a bias due to a different source of patients; however, after the matching process, we retrospectively observed that all 72 patients from the CAPUCI II cohort were enrolled from Spanish ICUs, thus minimizing the risk of a significant bias.\n\nMoreover, we did not perform genetic investigations, although recent publications have identified common variants in specific genes that are associated with different outcomes in severe pneumonia [27].\n\nFinally, as stated by Waterer [28], ICU outcome often differs from hospital outcome or from outcome on day 60 or 90 after admission.\n\nHowever, as shown in the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, the majority of deaths in our sample occurred within 14 days of admission.\n\nAlthough it is true that ICU mortality may differ from hospital or 3-month outcome, we feel that deferring excessively the time of the study of the outcome may complicate the analysis, because more variables that are difficult to record and interpret have to be introduced in the analysis as confounding variables.\n\nConclusionsIn the current study, mortality due to non-pneumococcal SCAP decreased between the two cohorts, and the use of combined antibiotic therapy and early antibiotic administration were associated with lower mortality.\n\nThese finding agree with the conclusions obtained in a previous study carried out in patients with pneumococcal SCAP from the same database [9].\n\nMore studies to confirm these findings are now needed.\n\nIn the meantime, all patients presenting at the emergency department with SCAP should receive two antibiotics within 3 hours of admission.\n\nKey messages In the last 14 years, a significant reduction in ICU mortality due to severe community-acquired pneumonia was observed.\n\nIn severe non-pneumococcal community-acquired pneumonia, early antibiotic administration and combination therapy were associated with a significant improved survival.\n\nA lower mortality was observed following early administration of combination therapy either in the subgroups of patients with shock, under mechanical ventilation and without shock or requirement of mechanical ventilation.\n\nThe most frequent etiologies in severe CAP in the present cohort were Staphylococcus aureus followed by Legionella pneumophila and Haemophilus influenzae.\n\nAbbreviations APACHE: Acute Physiology and Chronic

Trauma patients are mainly admitted to local hospitals with trauma centres.\n\nThe unit receives daily visits from a consultant microbiologist except on Sundays.\n\nThe source population consisted of all patients admitted to the ICU from 1 December 2012 to 31 May 2013 who either had community- or hospital-acquired bacteraemia, or who subsequently developed bacteraemia while in ICU.\n\nA comparison was made against data collected over a 6 month period from 1 February to 31 July 2000 when the ICU had 22 beds12 and was located in an older building.\n\nThe patient population was broadly similar, and included immunosuppressed patients with haematological and other malignancies.\n\nIn the first study period, blood cultures were often collected from vascular catheters already in situ, whereas following a change in unit policy, blood cultures were only collected using a fresh stab over the second study period.\n\nIn both periods blood cultures were only taken for a clinical indication rather than for any routine background surveillance or screening.\n\nClinical, microbiological and outcome data were obtained from the ICU, microbiology and hospital databases.\n\nPatients were included if they had microbiologically confirmed bacteraemia or fungaemia and fulfilled the diagnosis of bloodstream infection according to predefined criteria.\n\nThe same definitions were used as for the 2000 study, as shown in the Supplementary data (available at JAC Online).\n\nBeing a retrospective database audit, Ethics Committee permission was not sought.\n\nPatient characteristics and findings for both the frequency and sites of bloodstream infections were compared for the two study periods.\n\nData were also collected on resistance patterns, antibiotic type and duration, and patient outcomes.\n\nWe have not reported data on the types of antibiotic used but these are broadly identical across the two periods.\n\nCephalosporins are generally used as first-line agents for community-acquired infections, and piperacillin/tazobactam as first-line therapy for hospital- or ICU-acquired presumed Gram-negative infection, with meropenem reserved for subsequent infections, and an occasional use of gentamicin for complicated Gram-negative infections.\n\nWhere staphylococcal infection is suspected, flucloxacillin is used as a first-line therapy where methicillin resistance is unlikely (e.g. community acquired and not recently hospitalized); otherwise teicoplanin is used.\n\nWe considered statistical comparisons to be inappropriate as this is a purely descriptive comparison of practices, outcomes and resistance patterns 13 years apart, with some alterations in denominator values, in particular patient numbers and altered blood sampling techniques.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section Results The total number of ICU admissions increased from 713 patients in the 6 month study period in 2000, to 1318 patients in 2013.\n\nTable 1 summarizes the characteristics of patients in whom bacteraemia or fungaemia was found during these study periods.\n\nIn 2000, 102 episodes of bacteraemia or fungaemia occurred in 84 of the 713 patients (11.8%).\n\nBy comparison, there were 113 episodes among 87 admissions (6.6%) in 2013, of which 14 episodes occurred in just two patients with complicated intra-abdominal sepsis.\n\nIn the 2013 cohort more patients were admitted with community-acquired bacteraemia but fewer suffered ICU-acquired bacteraemia.\n\nView this table: In this window In a new window Table 1.\n\nPatient characteristics Figure 1 displays organisms cultured from blood in the two study periods.\n\nIn both periods the proportion of cases with Gram-positive bacteraemia outnumbered that with Gram-negative bacteraemia (59.8% in 2000 versus 54.3% in 2013).\n\nThe number of cases of MRSA, MDR Gram-negative bacteraemia and fluconazole-resistant Candida species decreased between the first and second study periods, particularly in terms of ICU-acquired bloodstream infections.\n\nThe number of MDR Gram-negative pathogens remained low (four in 2000, one in 2013), as did the number of episodes of breakthrough or relapse bacteraemia (Table 1).\n\nSpecifically, there were no subsequent episodes of either endocarditis or osteomyelitis.\n\nView larger version: In this window In a new window Download as PowerPoint Slide Figure

in 2000, 65.7% in 2013) (Table 2).\n\nWhile proportionally more patients received combination therapy for ICU-acquired bacteraemia, this was due in part to the declining number of cases of line-related bacteraemia (which is generally treated with monotherapy), and the increasing number of patients with haematological malignancy (18 versus 11).\n\nOf these 18, 12 received combination antibiotic therapy.\n\nView this table: In this window In a new window Table 2.\n\nAntibiotic treatment of bacteraemic patients The median duration of antibiotic treatment did not change over time.\n\nThe hospital mortality of bacteraemic patients was 45% in the 2000 cohort, and 32% in the 2013 cohort.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section Discussion Our long-standing strategy of a predominant use of short-course (5 day) antibiotic monotherapy given to ICU patients for community-, hospital- and ICU-acquired bacteraemia remains associated with a continued low level of antibiotic resistance and fungaemia, and low rates of breakthrough and relapse bacteraemia.\n\nHospital mortality in the bacteraemic/fungaemic patients improved from 45% in 2000 to 32% in 2013.\n\nIn conjunction with national data,14 the rate of MRSA infection has dropped markedly in recent years and no ICU-acquired MRSA bacteraemia was reported in the 2013 period.\n\nThe number of catheter-related ICU-acquired bacteraemias also fell from 27 in the 2000 cohort to 8 in the 2013 cohort.\n\nWhile this is related in part to the introduction of a care bundle for the prevention of intravascular catheter infection and to the earlier removal of catheters, the change in ICU policy to taking blood cultures only from fresh sites (venous or arterial) may be contributory.\n\nA recent systematic review and meta-analysis by Havey et al.15 was able to find 24 trials totalling 227 patients who were allocated to \u2018shorter\u2019 (5\u20137 days) versus \u2018longer\u2019 (7\u201321 days) durations of treatment, with outcome data available for only 155 patients.\n\nNo significant differences were noted in clinical or microbiological cure rates or patient survival, although the small sample sizes were acknowledged.\n\nThe same group performed a national practice survey among Canadian infectious disease and critical care specialists who recommended treatment durations of 7\u201314 days for bacteraemia related to central venous catheters, pneumonia and urinary tract, skin and soft tissue or intra-abdominal infection.16 Longer durations (mean 13.5 \u00b1 4.8 days) were recommended for Staphylococcus aureus infections and shorter periods (5.7 \u00b1 4 days) for CoNS.\n\nNotably, the use of multiple and/or prolonged duration antibiotics has been associated with worse outcomes in several recent observational studies.\n\nIn a multicentre observational study, Kett et al.17 found a significantly higher survival rate (79% versus 65%) in patients with suspected MDR pneumonia who received therapy not compliant with national guidelines recommending at least two antibiotics active against Gram-negative organisms plus one antibiotic against MRSA.\n\nIn a single-centre before\u2013after study, Hranjec et al.18 reported a significantly increased 2.5-fold increased mortality risk when adopting an aggressive antibiotic approach to treating infection on their surgical ICU; 20% of patients had bacteraemia.\n\nOf note, the duration of antibiotic therapy was significantly lower in the conservative (delayed-treatment) group.\n\nIn a multicentre study Jensen et al.19 reported that procalcitonin-guided antimicrobial escalation increased the duration of antibiotics from a median of 4 days (IQR 3\u201310) to 6 days (IQR 3\u201311) and that this was associated with organ-related harm and a longer ICU stay.\n\nIn a multicentre prospective observational study conducted in 2010, we were not able to show an impact of antibiotics on mortality in treating bacteraemia in critically ill patients.20 A wide variability in antibiotic usage may be responsible,21 especially as a recent study of 628 patients with severe sepsis and septic shock, of whom 241 patients (38.4%) had bacteraemia, demonstrated lower mortality rates in those in whom antibiotic therapy was de-escalated.22 In addition to direct patient outcomes, the importance of shorter antibiotic courses to reduce the selective pressure on bacterial flora and the prevent emergence of resistance has been emphasized.7\u20139 This is particularly pertinent as mortality rates are higher in critically ill patients with MDR organisms10,23 while antimicrobial resistance is on the rise worldwide, particularly with Gram-negative organisms.24\u201326 Likewise, nosocomial candidaemia is associated with high levels of both crude and attributable mortality.27 A prospective surveillance study revealed that infection with a fluconazole-resistant Candida species was associated with prior exposure to carbapenems, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, clindamycin and colistin.28 The lack of any fluconazole-resistant Candida species in our 2013 cohort may thus be linked to the short-course antibiotic strategy in use.\n\nThe limitations of our study include the use of only single-centre data that were collected retrospectively, with the establishment of the diagnosis and source of the infection depending on the quality of documentation.\n\nThus, case ascertainment may have been incorrect in some instances.\n\nThe number of cases of ICU-acquired bacteraemia fell in 2013, with a particular reduction noted in Enterococcus, Klebsiella and S.\n\naureus, yet resistance patterns in the remaining cases did not alter.\n\nOn the other hand, the number of community- and hospital-acquired cases increased, although resistance patterns also remained unchanged with the exception of hospital-acquired candidaemia, for which no fluconazole resistance was noted in 2013.\n\nIn line with the UK in general, we have also seen an expansion in the number of critical care beds in the intervening 13 years.\n\nThere have also been some changes in the subspecialty surgery performed at the hospital related to reorganizations within the London area, but the patient mix remains broadly similar in terms of the percentages of medical, surgical, oncological and immunosuppressed populations.\n\nThe particular demographic mix of our ICU patient population, including a large number of immunosuppressed patients with, for example, haematological malignancy, alcoholic liver disease and/or HIV, and patients with complex abdominal failure, makes it difficult to draw a direct comparison against outcomes in other ICUs. Even in our high-risk population, our antibiotic strategy appears to be successful in terms of good patient outcomes and the maintenance of low resistance rates, especially when compared with the rising incidence of resistance reported in many countries including the USA and Europe.\n\nIn conclusion, the apparent success of our strategy over many years, with continued low levels of antimicrobial resistance and breakthrough or relapse bacteraemia with the same organism, does suggest the efficacy and safety of this short-course antibiotic approach.\n\nIdeally, prospective controlled studies should be performed in other ICUs to confirm these findings, with extension over several years to monitor antibiotic resistance patterns.\n\nWhether this restricted antibiotic strategy can also impact positively upon units with an established problem with antibiotic resistance merits separate investigation.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section Funding This study was supported by

licensee BioMed Central.\n\n2015Received: 19 February 2015Accepted: 3 March 2015Published: 19 March 2015 Open Peer Review reports Abstract Background Recently we developed and validated generic quality indicators that define \u2018appropriate antibiotic use\u2019 in hospitalized adults treated for a (suspected) bacterial infection.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that with appropriate antibiotic use a reduction of 13% of length of hospital stay can be achieved.\n\nOur main objective in this project is to provide hospitals with an antibiotic checklist based on these quality indicators, and to evaluate the introduction of this checklist in terms of (cost-) effectiveness.\n\nMethods/Design The checklist applies to hospitalized adults with a suspected bacterial infection for whom antibiotic therapy is initiated, at first via the intravenous route.\n\nA stepped wedge study design will be used, comparing outcomes before and after introduction of the checklist in nine hospitals in the Netherlands.\n\nAt least 810 patients will be included in both the control and the intervention group.\n\nThe primary endpoint is length of hospital stay.\n\nSecondary endpoints are appropriate antibiotic use measured by the quality indicators, admission to and duration of intensive care unit stay, readmission within 30 days, mortality, total antibiotic use, and costs associated with implementation and hospital stay.\n\nDifferences in numerical endpoints between the two periods will be evaluated with mixed linear models; for dichotomous outcomes generalized estimating equation models will be used.\n\nA process evaluation will be performed to evaluate the professionals\u2019 compliance with use of the checklist.\n\nThe key question for the economic evaluation is whether the benefits of the checklist, which include reduced antibiotic use, reduced length of stay and associated costs, justify the costs associated with implementation activities as well as daily use of the checklist.\n\nDiscussion If (cost-) effective, the AB-checklist will provide physicians with a tool to support appropriate antibiotic use in adult hospitalized patients who start with intravenous antibiotics.\n\nTrial registration Dutch trial registry: NTR4872 Keywords Checklist Antibiotics Implementation Quality indicators Stepped-wedge design Background The need to improve antibiotic use The increasing antimicrobial resistance rate is one of the most important health care problems at this moment.\n\nThe total consumption of antibiotics is the main driving force [1,2].\n\nThe World Health Organization signalled the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), along with the steady decline in the discovery of new antimicrobials, as a major health threat for the coming decade.\n\nTo help control AMR, a better use of the current agents is necessary [3].\n\nRecent studies have shown considerable room for improvement in the two most common bacterial infections: respiratory and urinary tract infections [4,5].\n\nAn important question is how to achieve such an improvement.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that appropriate antibiotic use is not only of great importance to curb antimicrobial resistance, but also has a short-term consequence.\n\nThe evaluation of antibiotic treatment for urinary tract infections in hospitals showed an inverse relationship between the proportion of appropriate antibiotic use in a patient and length of stay (LOS).\n\nPrescribing therapy in accordance with local hospital guidelines was associated with a shorter LOS (7.3 days vs.\n\n8.7 days; P = 0.024) [6].\n\nRecently a similar inverse relationship has been shown between appropriate antibiotic use in treatment of all bacterial infections in the hospital and LOS, with a reduction of 13% in LOS with appropriate use.\n\n[Abstract poster: Quality Indicators for Monitoring Appropriate Antibiotic Use in Hospitals: an Important Tool for Antibiotic Stewardship.\n\nK-325.\n\n54th Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, September 5 -9, 2014, Washington DC].\n\nQuality indicators Guidelines defining appropriate antimicrobial treatment are available.\n\nTo measure whether guideline recommendations are implemented in daily practice, an instrument is needed that validly measures the quality of antibiotic use in daily clinical practice.\n\nGuideline-based quality indicators (QIs) are such tools.\n\nRecently, generic QIs for the antimicrobial treatment of bacterial infections in hospitals have been developed and validated [7].\n\nThe challenge is the embedding of appropriate antibiotic use, as defined by these QIs, in daily practice.\n\nChecklist A checklist can be a tool for implementation; since it has been shown in other high-risk disciplines that adherence to checklists increases safety [8].\n\nThis also holds true for the field of medicine.\n\nFor example, in surgery, implementation of a comprehensive multidisciplinary SURgical PAtient Safety System (SURPASS) is associated with an absolute risk reduction in surgical complications of 10.6% [9].\n\nSimilarly, the introduction of a checklist to improve patient care among gynaecologic oncology patients has resulted in a decreased length of stay of one day (4.5 days in the pre- and 3.5 days in the post-implementation period (P = 0.007)) [10].\n\nIn the field of infectious diseases, Pronovost et al.\n\nshowed that introduction of a five-points checklist to reduce infections when inserting a central venous catheter, resulted in a decrease of the median rate of infections from 2.7 per 1,000 patients to zero after three months [11].\n\nWe hypothesize that an antibiotic checklist, to be used at the start of antibiotic treatment and after 48-72 hours of treatment, will improve clinical patient care, reduce costs and will ultimately contribute to the containment of antimicrobial resistance.\n\nObjectives This study is set to implement an antibiotic checklist based on the validated generic quality indicators measuring the appropriateness of intravenously initiated antibiotic use in hospitalized adults treated for a suspected bacterial infection, and to analyse the effect of the introduction of the checklist on patient care in terms of shorter duration of intensive care unit (ICU)- and hospital stay, adequate treatment, decreased mortality rates, decreased total antibiotic use and lower costs.\n\nMethods and design Phase 1: The AB-checklist and barriers for use The \u2018Development of reliable generic quality indicators for the optimization of antibiotic use in the hospital\u2019 (RIANT)-study used a RAND modified Delphi method to develop a set of generic QIs for appropriate antibiotic use in the treatment of all bacterial infections in hospitalized adult patients [7].\n\nThe clinimetric properties of these QIs have been tested in 1,890 hospitalized patients, in 22 Dutch hospitals.\n\nThis analysis resulted in eight useful QIs, of which seven were process indicators that focus on the actual care provided.\n\nThe antibiotic checklist includes these seven QIs. The antibiotic checklist is intended as a reminding tool for the physician who starts intravenous (IV) antibiotic treatment.\n\nIt is actually divided into two bundles (Figure 1).\n\nThe first bundle has to be completed at the moment of prescribing IV antibiotics, and comprises five items.\n\nThe second bundle is used during the course of treatment, at the latest after 72 hours of treatment.\n\nThis part consists of two items.\n\nFigure 1 The antibiotic checklist.\n\nAs a preparation, we identified barriers of implementing this checklist, using a questionnaire based on an instrument of the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO), which is designed to survey determinants that influence the uptake of an innovation in health care organizations [12,13].\n\nThe questionnaire was sent to specialists and residents who work at the participating hospitals.\n\nBased on the identified barriers, the checklist design and its implementation format were adapted.\n\nPhase 2: cluster randomized clinical trial to evaluate the AB-checklist Study design and setting The (cost-) effectiveness of introducing the antibiotic checklist will be studied in a controlled, multicentre, prospective study using a stepped wedge design, comparing outcomes before and after implementation of the checklist while accounting for potential confounders [14].\n\nThe checklist will be introduced in nine hospitals over four time periods, during a total study period of eleven months (Figure 2).\n\nThe aim is to include at least 810 patients in the period before- (the baseline group), and at least 810 patients with a completed checklist in the period after checklist introduction (intervention group).\n\nDuring the transition period implementation activities will be started and no patients will be included.\n\nThis period runs from one month before introduction of the checklist to one week after introduction.\n\nSince compliance to the checklist will not be 100%, we will also collect data concerning the LOS from the patients in whom the checklist should have been but was not completed during the period after checklist introduction (the spill over group).\n\nFigure 2 The stepped wedge design for checklist implementation.\n\nTo promote selection of a patient population representative for every day clinical practice in the Netherlands, two university hospitals and seven teaching hospitals will participate, and in each hospital at least one surgical and one non-surgical ward will be included.\n\nThe ICU and the paediatric ward will be excluded, as the quality indicators do not apply to these populations.\n\nPatients with a suspected bacterial infection presenting on the emergency department (ED) will be included if they are going to be hospitalized on one of the participating wards.\n\nIntervention The study coordinator will design a project plan together with the local project leader.\n\nThis plan will focus on physicians, nurses and medical students who are involved in patient care.\n\nThe plan will include standard items (see Table 1), but additional items can be added, if locally required, to cover practical issues as for example: How do we arrange that for each patient starting with antibiotics intravenously a checklist is filled in?\n\nHow do we arrange that the checklist does not get lost?Table 1 Description

projectMedical studentsLetter, website, e-learning Patient enrolment Eligible patients The physician will use the checklist in all hospitalized adults (\u226518 years old), or adults at the ED who will be admitted at a participating ward, with a suspected community-acquired and/or hospital-acquired bacterial infection, and will be treated with intravenous antibiotics.\n\nThe treating physician identifies these patients upon prescription of antibiotic therapy.\n\nThe patients included in the study are all patients that meet the above mentioned inclusion criteria, whether they have a completed checklist or not (see Figure 3 for the flowchart).\n\nThey will be included in each hospital using an overview of the patients who started with intravenous antibiotics.\n\nThis overview will be generated by the local departments of hospital pharmacy from the computerized physician order entry systems.\n\nPatients are excluded from the study in case of anticipated hospital stay of less than 24 hours, antibiotics used as prophylaxis or intended for less than 24 hours, hospitalization at the ICU at the start of the treatment, transfer from another hospital, or antibiotic treatment in the ambulance before presentation at the ED.\n\nFigure 3 Flowchart of the included patient in our study.\n\nPrimary and secondary endpoints The primary endpoint is length of hospital stay in days.\n\nLOS in community-acquired infections will be defined as the number of days between admission and discharge.\n\nIn hospital-acquired infections LOS will be defined as the number of days between start of antibiotic treatment and discharge.\n\nSecondary endpoints are appropriate antibiotic treatment according to the generic QIs (yes/no per QI and sum score of all QIs) [6], admission to and duration of ICU stay in days, readmission within 30 days, mortality in the hospital and in the first 30 days after discharge, total antibiotic use, costs of hospital stay and costs associated with implementation.\n\nAssessments For patient outcome we will collect data concerning the LOS, admission to and duration of ICU stay, readmission within 30 days and mortality in hospital or within 30 days after discharge for the baseline group and the intervention group.\n\nFurthermore we will collect data for possible confounders of patient\u2019s outcome, namely age, sex, community-or hospital acquired infection, Charlson comorbidity index [15,16], use of antibiotics during the previous 30 days, and clinical condition as assessed by the Modified Early Warning System [17].\n\nTo calculate QI performance we will collect data concerning the number of taken blood cultures including its results, the number of taken cultures of suspected sides of infection including its results, antibiotic use including dose, interval and duration of treatment in days, the (suspected) type of infection and relevant laboratory parameters.\n\nFor the spill over group, we will only collect data concerning the LOS and the possible confounders.\n\nAntibiotics included in the study belong to group J01 (antimicrobials for systemic use) of the Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system.\n\nWhen multiple antibiotics are prescribed to one patient, all antibiotics will be registered.\n\nAntiviral therapy, medication for tuberculosis, antibiotics used for non-systemic selective intestinal decontamination and antibiotics used as pro-kinetics will be excluded.\n\nSample size The power analysis is based on previous results of appropriate antibiotic use on length of stay as described at \u2018background\u2019 [6,7].\n\nIn a simulation study based on the stepped wedge design, with nine hospitals each contributing 180 patients with a suspected infection, we estimated the power to approximate 80% to demonstrate a significant reduction of 13% in length of stay, assuming that the intraclass correlation coefficient does not exceed 0.20.\n\nWith each hospital contributing 180 patients with a suspected infection, the total sample size will be 1620 patients.\n\nFor each hospital we have determined a minimum number of patients in the baseline group and intervention group, depending on the randomization order of the hospital in the stepped wedge.\n\nAnalysis Effect evaluation We will use mixed linear models to analyse the overall effect of the introduction of the checklist on length of stay.\n\nTherefore we will evaluate differences between baseline (before introduction of the checklist) and intervention plus spill over (after introduction of the checklist) (intention to treat analysis).\n\nWe will also determine the theoretical effect of the checklist on LOS by evaluating differences between baseline and intervention data without the spill over data (per protocol analysis).\n\nDifferences between the baseline data and the intervention data for secondary outcomes will also be evaluated with mixed linear models.\n\nFor dichotomous outcomes (mortality), the comparison will be evaluated with a similar approach, using generalized estimating equation models.\n\nThese mixed models account for within-cluster dependencies, and allow adjustment for possible confounders.\n\nTo assess whether differences between these groups may be explained by confounding patient characteristics, we will first test with multivariate multilevel (linear mixed) analyses if these variables have a significant effect (p < 0.05) on the outcomes.\n\nHereafter, we will compute the estimate of the total causal effect of checklist implementation on the outcomes before and after adjusting for a significant variable.\n\nIf the estimate varies 10% or more, possible confounding is present and in that case we will adjust for this variable.\n\nValidation and process evaluation We will evaluate the physicians\u2019 compliance with the checklist.\n\nFirstly we will check whether the ticks in the completed checklists are in accordance with the performance in clinical practice.\n\nSecondly we will determine the percentage of eligible patients for whom the checklist has been used after checklist introduction.\n\nThe number of patients in whom the checklist was actually used (the intervention group) will be divided by the number of patients in whom it should have been used (the intervention plus the spill over group).\n\nEconomic evaluation The key question for the economic evaluation is whether the benefits of using the checklist, which will likely include reduced antibiotic use, reduced length of stay and associated costs, justify the costs associated with implementation activities as well as daily use of the checklist.\n\nFor reasons of feasibility, the cost analysis will only include a few main cost drivers of health care utilization, namely LOS on a general or ICU ward and antibiotic use.\n\nUnit costs for health care utilization will be estimated according to the Dutch guideline on (unit) costing in health care [18].\n\nLOS and ICU stay will be valued based on the guideline prices.\n\nFurthermore, we will compare the total antibiotic use in days per antibiotic class in the baseline and the intervention group.\n\nAntibiotic costs will not be valued because the benefits become more evident in terms of reduced quantities rather than their particular costs.\n\nImplementation costs will be divided in non-recurring and recurring costs.\n\nNon-recurring costs are related to our study, such as costs of the development of the materials, the implementation strategy and costs of evaluation of the implementation.\n\nRecurring costs are the costs of accomplishment of the implementation strategy.\n\nThe primary analysis is a cost-effectiveness analysis, with the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio expressed as the implementation related costs per reduction of length of stay in days.\n\nAs we hypothesize that an effective implementation of the checklist will result in reduced health care use and thus lower costs, we will also perform a cost-benefit analysis, evaluating whether the implementation costs are offset by this cost reduction (costs of implementation < health care cost reduction).\n\nRobustness of the results for uncertainty in the assumptions will be evaluated in sensitivity analyses, including estimates of unit costs and volume of implementation activities (considering less activities will be needed if checklists become part of standard care).\n\nIn a budget impact analysis results from the economic evaluation will be extrapolated to the national level to estimate the total clinical and budget impact in terms of health benefits, reduction in antibiotic use, and associated economic impact on the health care budget per annum for the Netherlands.\n\nThe budget impact analysis will be performed according to the criteria provided by Mauskopf et al.\n\n[19], from a societal perspective as well as from the health insurance and/or national health care budgeting framework perspective.\n\nWe will evaluate the impact of varying implementation rates, comparing care as usual (0% implementation), potential impact (100% implementation), and the probable rates of 85% and 50% implementation.\n\nEthical considerations The project proposal was discussed with the Medical Ethics Research Committee of the Academic Medical Centre.\n\nThey confirmed that the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Acts does not apply to this study and that an official approval by the committee was not required, because patients will receive treatment according to standard care, and will have no burden of checklist use.\n\nDiscussionThis study protocol describes the design, implementation and evaluation of the AB-checklist study.\n\nTo our knowledge, no other published studies or ongoing trials (http://\u200bapps.\u200bwho.\u200bint/\u200btrialsearch/\u200b) investigate the implementation of a generic antibiotic checklist to be used for suspected bacterial infections in the hospital.\n\nIf (cost) effective, the AB-checklist will provide physicians with a tool to support appropriate antibiotic use in adult hospitalized patients who start intravenous antimicrobials.\n\nAbbreviations AB: Antibiotic AMR: Antimicrobial resistance ED: Emergency department ICU: Intensive care unit IV: Intravenous LOS: Length

2014.\n\nAccepted September 19, 2014.\n\nNext Section Abstract STUDY QUESTION What is the prevalence of chronic endometritis (CE) in women with repeated unexplained implantation failure (RIF) at IVF, and how does antibiotic treatment affect the reproductive outcome?\n\nSUMMARY ANSWER Chronic endometritis, associated with infection with common bacteria or mycoplasma, is common in women complaining of RIF and antibiotic treatment significantly improves the reproductive outcome at a subsequent IVF cycle.\n\nWHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY We have reported that CE is a frequent finding in women with repeated pregnancy loss and a significantly higher rate of successful pregnancies was achieved after adequate antibiotic treatment.\n\nMoreover, CE was identified in 30.3% of patients with repeated implantation failure at IVF and women diagnosed with CE had lower implantation rates (11.5%) after IVF cycles.\n\nIn contrast, other authors reported that the clinical implication of CE should be considered minimal and that the reproductive outcome at IVF/ICSI cycles was not negatively affected by CE.\n\nSTUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION A retrospective study was performed from January 2009 through June 2012 on 106 women with unexplained infertility and a history of RIF.\n\nPARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS All patients underwent hysteroscopy and endometrial sampling for histology and microbiological investigations.\n\nWomen diagnosed with CE underwent antibiotic treatment and the effect of treatment was confirmed by hysteroscopy with biopsy.\n\nWithin 6 months after treatment all women had a further IVF attempt.\n\nThe IVF outcomes were compared in women without signs of CE (Group 1) and persistent CE (Group 2) after antibiotic treatment.\n\nClinical pregnancy rate (PR), and live birth rate (LBR) were compared at post-treatment IVF attempt.\n\nMAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE Seventy (66.0%) women were diagnosed with CE at hysteroscopy.\n\nIn 61 (57.5%) CE was confirmed by histology and 48 (45.0%) by cultures.\n\nCommon bacteria and mycoplasma were the most prevalent agents.\n\nIn 46 (75.4%) out of 61 women, with diagnosis of CE at hysteroscopy and histology, examinations were normal after appropriate antibiotic treatment control (Group 1) while in 15 (24.6%) cases signs of CE were still present (Group 2).\n\nAt IVF attempt after treatment, a significantly higher PR and LBR was reported in women from Group 1 compared with women from Group 2 (65.2 versus 33.0% P = 0.039; 60.8 versus 13.3%, P = 0.02, respectively).\n\nLIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION Possible biases related to retrospective studies and to preferential referral of patients with CE, and limited number of cases.\n\nWIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS A prospective randomized clinical trial is needed to confirm our findings but in women with RIF a hysteroscopic evaluation of the uterine cavity to exclude CE should be considered and appropriate antibiotic treatment should be given before submitting the patient to a further IVF attempt.\n\nSTUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S) This research was funded by the University personal research grants of Ettore Cicinelli.\n\nThe authors have no competing interests to declare.\n\nKey words IVF/ICSI outcome chronic endometritis antibiotic treatment repeated implantation failure hysteroscopy Previous SectionNext Section Introduction The pregnancy rate following one cycle of IVF and embryo transfer can be as high as 60% (Margalioth et al., 2006).\n\nHowever, even in the very successful units, some couples fail repeatedly.\n\nFailure could be caused by many different factors such as inappropriate ovarian stimulation, suboptimal laboratory culture conditions and faults in embryo transfer techniques.\n\nRepeated implantation failure (RIF) is defined as failure to conceive following two or three embryo transfer cycles, or cumulative transfer of >10 good quality embryos (El-Toukhy and Taranissi, 2006).\n\nImplantation failure is related to either maternal factors or embryonic causes.\n\nMaternal factors include uterine anatomic abnormalities, thrombophilia, non-receptive endometrium and immunological factors (Salim et al., 2002).\n\nAlthough uterine abnormalities are considered to have a relevant impact on the chances to conceive through IVF, conventional infertility investigations, based on ultrasound and hysterosalpingography (HSG), may miss subtle intrauterine lesions (La Sala et al., 1998; Oliveira et al., 2003; Fatemi et al., 2010).\n\nAt hysteroscopy prior to IVF the prevalence of unsuspected intrauterine abnormalities has been demonstrated to range between 11 and 45% (Fatemi et al., 2010); accordingly, recent reports suggest that hysteroscopy in the cycle preceding ovarian stimulation, could be useful for patients with RIF (Fatemi and Popovic-Todorovic, 2013).\n\nOne of the abnormalities, which cannot be detected with ultrasound and HSG, is chronic endometritis (CE) that is a subtle pathology often asymptomatic or only accompanied by mild disturbances.\n\nHistological identification of plasma cells in the endometrial stroma is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis (Kasius et al., 2011) but due to the normal presence of leukocytes in the endometrium especially before menstruation, even histology may miss the diagnosis.\n\nIn our previous papers, we demonstrated that fluid hysteroscopy reliably diagnoses CE based on the demonstration of specific signs such as micro-polyps, stromal edema and focal or diffuse hyperemia (Cicinelli et al., 2005, 2008).\n\nChronic endometritis may hamper endometrial receptivity and may cause infertility because the endometrium is characterized by an abnormal pattern of lymphocyte subsets and, consequently, an aberrant endometrial microenvironment (Matteo et al., 2009).\n\nIn a recent paper, we demonstrated that in women with repeated abortions, CE is a frequent finding and that women who received adequate antibiotic treatment had a significantly higher rate of successful pregnancies compared with women who were not treated or with persistent disease (Cicinelli et al., 2014).\n\nMoreover, CE was identified in 30.3% of patients with repeated implantation failure at IVF and women diagnosed with CE had lower implantation rates (11.5%) after an IVF cycle (Quaas and Dokras, 2008).\n\nIn contrast, Kasius and coworkers reported that the clinical implication of CE seems minimal since they diagnosed this condition in \u223c2% of asymptomatic infertile patients with a normal transvaginal ultrasound examination (TVS) (Kasius et al., 2011).\n\nThe same author reported that the reproductive outcome at IVF/ICSI cycles was not negatively affected by CE and that the low prevalence and unknown clinical significance of endometritis warrants further study (Kasius et al., 2011, 2012).\n\nDue to the controversial role of CE in assisted reproduction and the vast experience of our group in hysteroscopic and histological fields, in the present study we wanted to evaluate the effects of CE on RIF at IVF.\n\nFor this purpose, we evaluated retrospectively the prevalence of CE at hysteroscopy, histology and endometrial cultures, in a population of women who experienced RIF at IVF due to unexplained infertility and the IVF outcome after specific antibiotic treatment.\n\nIn detail, we compared the live birth rates at the first IVF attempt within 6 months after treatment between women in whom CE was successfully treated and those in whom it was still present after treatment.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section Materials and Methods Subjects Two hundred and fifty-six women were referred to our department for hysteroscopy due to previous IVF failure in the period January 2009\u2013June 2012.\n\nWe analyzed retrospectively the charts of 106 of these who were affected by unexplained infertility and RIF as defined above and who were known to have planned a further attempt of IVF within 6 months after our assessment.\n\nInclusion criteria were: absence of any abnormality at transvaginal ultrasound and at HSG, age <40 years, at least six good quality embryos transferred in three or more previous IVF/ICSI cycles without signs of implantation, normal response with at least six oocytes retrieved with standard induction protocol, normal parental peripheral karyotype.\n\nExclusion criteria were as follows: FSH on day 3 > 10 mUI/ml, BMI > 30 mUI/ml, history of clinical repeated pregnancy loss, previous surgery for myoma and/or endometriosis, ultrasound diagnosis of ovarian endometriomas, corticosteroid treatment or other medical treatments known to interfere with immune system, known clinical autoimmune disease, antiphospholipid syndrome, thrombophilic condition requiring anticoagulant therapy, presence of antisperm antibodies, unwillingness to give informed consent.\n\nAll infertile women had undergone the following examinations recommended for the basic infertility evaluation (Quaas and Dokras, 2008): semen analysis of the partner, testing for detection of ovulation (mid luteal progesterone, LH kit), assessment of ovarian reserve, transvaginal ultrasound, and hysterosalpingography.\n\nDiagnosis and treatment of CE In our department, women underwent diagnostic mini-hysteroscopy in the follicular phase of menstrual cycle.\n\nMini-hysteroscopy was performed using a lens-based 3 mm OD mini-telescope, 105\u00b0 angle of visual field equipped with a 3.5 mm OD single-flow diagnostic sheath (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) as previously described (Cicinelli et al., 2008).\n\nSaline was employed to distend the uterine cavity.\n\nA 300 W light source with a xenon bulb, a digital camera (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) and a 21 inch video color screen were used.\n\nThe exploration of the uterine cavity consisted of a panoramic view of the cavity followed by a thorough evaluation of the endometrial mucosa.\n\nAll hysteroscopies were performed by two of the authors (E.C., M.M.) and pictures were recorded in digital format.\n\nIn all women enrolled in the study both authors agreed about the diagnosis of CE based on the demonstration of micro-polyps, polypoid endometrium, stromal edema and focal or diffuse hyperemia, as previously published (Cicinelli et al., 2005, 2008).\n\nIn the follicular phase of the subsequent cycle, an endometrial biopsy using a 3 mm Novak's curette connected to a 20 ml syringe was performed for cultural and histological purposes to search for infectious agents such as common bacteria, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma species, Ureaplasma urealyticum and yeast.\n\nIn order to minimize the risk that endometrial cultures could be contaminated in the vagina, after placing a vaginal speculum and cleaning external uterine ostium by using a gauze soaked in iodine solution, the Novak's cannula was inserted under visual control into the uterine cavity taking care to avoid any contact with vaginal walls.\n\nEndometrial samples were diluted into 2 ml of saline and divided into two aliquots, one for infectious agent investigations and the other placed in formalin for histological examination.\n\nBased on the infectious agent detected and on the antibiogram result, an appropriate antibiotic treatment was prescribed.\n\nIn the follicular phase of the cycle following the therapy all women were asked to attend the clinic again to re-evaluate uterine cavity by hysteroscopy for signs of CE and to collect endometrial samples for histology and culture.\n\nTreatment was repeated for a maximum of three cycles but stopped earlier if the cultures were negative and both hysteroscopic and histologic findings had normalized.\n\nAt the end of treatment, women had their planned IVF treatment cycle at the same center as their previous attempts.\n\nMicrobiological analysis Endometrial specimens for N.\n\ngonorrhoeae were immediately placed in Stuart's transport medium and transported to the laboratory.\n\nIn the laboratory, endometrial specimens were Gram-negative stained; then the endometrial specimens were plated into appropriate agar medium, 5% sheep blood Columbia Agar Base, Chocolate Agar, Mannitol Salt Agar and Mac Conkey Agar (Bio Merieux, Rome, Italy) and the presence of micro-organisms was evaluated.\n\nThe plates were incubated for 48 h in air or 5% carbon dioxide.\n\nBacteria were identified using published criteria (Dade International, Inc., Milan, Italy).\n\nGenital mycoplasmas were quantitatively detected by immunoassay (Mycoplasma-IST, Biomerieux, and Rome, Italy).\n\nChlamydia was tested by RT\u2013PCR.\n\nFor yeast's isolation, specimens were plated into Sabouraud Chloramphenicol Agar and identification was made by using commercial kits (API-C System, Biomerieux, Rome, Italy).\n\nHistological analysis Endometrial samples were fixed in neutral formalin and later embedded in paraffin for histological analysis.\n\nFive-micrometer sections were stained with hematoxilin-eosin.\n\nHistological diagnosis of CE was based on criteria previously described (Cicinelli et al., 2009).\n\nAttention was paid to the following features: superficial stromal edema, increased stromal density, pleomorphic stromal inflammatory infiltrate dominated by lymphocytes and plasma cells.\n\nFor this study in order to eliminate the inter-observer variability in all patients considered the histological examinations were re-evaluated by a single author (L.R.) who was unaware of previous histological and hysteroscopic findings.\n\nIn all cases considered, the re-evaluation confirmed the previous results.\n\nIVF protocol All patients underwent IVF in one of two high-volume (>500 procedures/years) centers in Italy.\n\nOvulation induction was performed by recombinant FSH (175\u2013225 IU/day) starting on Day 2 of the menstrual cycle.\n\nGnRH antagonist (0.125 mg/day, Cetrorelix, Serono) was given beginning on Day 5 of rFSH injection, or when the leading follicle reached 10 mm, to the day of hCG administration.\n\nOnce at least two leading follicles reached a size of \u226517 mm, 10 000 IU of urinary hCG was administrated to trigger ovulation.\n\nOvum retrieval was performed 34 h after the hCG injection.\n\nNo more than three embryos with at least one of good quality per procedure were transferred transvaginally on Day 3 of culture.\n\nThe luteal phase was supported with vaginal progesterone.\n\nReproductive parameters calculation All women diagnosed with CE at hysteroscopy and histology were contacted by telephone and asked about the reproductive outcome at the first IVF cycle performed within 6 months after therapy.\n\nThe following outcomes were retrospectively evaluated: implantation rate, clinical pregnancy rate (PR), first trimester miscarriage and live birth rate (LBR).\n\nImplantation rate was defined as the percentage of embryos implanting successfully relative to the total number of embryos transferred.\n\nClinical pregnancy rate per transfers was defined as the proportion of transfers that resulted in at least one intrauterine gestational sac documented by ultrasound.\n\nLive birth rate was defined as the number of transfers that resulted in live birth.\n\nAll women confirmed their consent to use their data, anonymously, for research purposes.\n\nStatistical analyses Clinical features were compared by using Chi-square test.\n\nChi-square test and Fisher exact test, where appropriate, were used to compare the implantation rate, the clinical pregnancy rate, the live birth rate (LBR) and the number of miscarriages.\n\nStatistical analysis was performed by using Epi Info 6.04 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA); a P < 0.05 was considered as the limit for significance.\n\nEthical approval This retrospective study was approved by the local ethical committee.\n\nAll women gave their informed consent to use, anonymously, their data for research purposes.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section Results The patients were aged 23\u201340 years; mean \u00b1 SD 31.9\u00b1 4.1 years.\n\nSeventy (66.0%) out of 106 women enrolled were diagnosed with CE at hysteroscopy, 61 (57.5%) cases were also positive at histology, while 48 (45%) were positive also at cultures (Fig.\n\n1).\n\nIn 36 women at hysteroscopy no evidence of CE was found; accordingly histology was also negative for CE (Fig.\n\n1).\n\nIn 34 (70.7%) out of 48 cases positive at cultures, common bacteria (Escherichia Coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, etc.) were found.\n\nMycoplasma and Ureaplasma urealyticum were detected in 14 (29.6%) cases (in 3 cases Ureaplasma and common bacteria coexisted) and Chlamydia in 4 cases (8.4%) (Table I).\n\nIn 40 (83.3%) out of 48 patients with positive cultures, after antibiogram guided antibiotic treatment the control hysteroscopy as well as histology and cultures became negative while in the other 8 (17%) cases, signs of CE were still present at the last hysteroscopic and histologic evaluation.\n\nIn 13 cases which, at first evaluation, were positive at hysteroscopy and histology but not at cultures, a broad spectrum antibiotic therapy based on Centers for Disease Control guidelines was proposed; after therapy in 6 out 13 (46%) women both hysteroscopy and the histology were normal while in the remaining 7 (54%) women signs of CE were still present (Fig.\n\n1).\n\nView this table: In this window In a

day for 10 days was employed as first line therapy.\n\nIn case of Gram positive bacteria, Amoxicillin + Clavulanate 1 g twice a day for 8 days was prescribed.\n\nMycoplasma and U.\n\nurealyticum were treated with Josamycin 1 g twice a day for 12 days while, in case of persistence, Minocycline 100 mg twice a day for 12 days was employed.\n\nIn women with negative cultures a treatment based on Ceftriaxone 250 mg IM in a single dose plus Doxycycline 100 mg orally twice a day for 14 days with Metronidazole 500 mg orally twice a day for 14 days, according to Centers for Disease Control guidelines, was administered.\n\nIn case of persistence of signs of CE at subsequent hysteroscopy, the protocol was repeated up to three times.\n\nIn detail, in 17 cases (37%) signs of CE were negative after a single treatment, in 14 cases (30.4%) two treatments and in 15 cases (32.6%) three treatments.\n\nThe 61 women who were initially positive for CE by both hysteroscopy and histology were divided into two groups based on findings of the final hysteroscopic and histologic examination: 46 patients with a normal hysteroscopic and histologic pattern (Group 1) and 15 with persistence of CE at hysteroscopy and histology (Group 2).\n\nClinical features of both groups are reported in Table II.\n\nWe contacted the women by telephone and asked the outcome of their first IVF cycle within 6 months after treatment.\n\nView this table: In this window In a new window Table II Clinical characteristics of women, number of previous IVF attempts and results in terms of implantation

IVF cycle after treatment had a successful ovarian stimulation and underwent to the embryo transfer on Day 3.\n\nThe mean number of embryos transferred at the first IVF cycle after treatment was 1.95 \u00b1 0.5 in group 1 and 1.93 \u00b1 0.4 in group 2.\n\nNo difference was observed between the two groups in the total number of embryos transferred nor in the mean number of good quality embryos transferred (1.3 \u00b1 0.4 in group 1 versus 1.4 \u00b1 0.5 in group 2).\n\nThe clinical pregnancy rate per transfer was significantly higher in Group 1 compared with Group 2 (65 versus 33%; Fisher exact test: P = 0.039.) (Table II) Accordingly, in women from Group 1 the LBR was significantly higher compared with Group 2 (61 versus 13%, respectively, P = 0.02) (Table II).\n\nThe implantation rate was higher in Group 1 compared with Group 2 (37 versus 17%) although difference did not reach statistical significance (Chi-square test P = 0.069).\n\nNo significant difference was observed in the number of first trimester miscarriages, two cases were recorded in Group 1 and 3 cases in Group 2 (Table II).\n\nThe percentage of successful IVF at 6 months after treatment in women previously diagnosed with CE and treated based on antibiogram results or Centers for Disease Control guidelines is displayed in Fig.\n\n2.\n\nResults were divided based on resolution or persistence of signs of CE at the end of treatment.\n\nView larger version: In this window In a new window Download as PowerPoint Slide Figure 2 The live birth rate achieved in the first IVF cycle within 6 months after treatment in women previously diagnosed with chronic endometritis (CE) and treated based on antibiogram results or Centers for Disease Control guidelines.\n\nResults were divided based on resolution or persistence of signs of CE at the end of treatment.\n\nNo significant difference in LBR was observed between women whose CE resolved after a single treatment and those whose CE required two or three treatments to resolve.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section Discussion The results of this retrospective study add further evidence to the relationship between CE and impaired endometrial receptivity.\n\nThe study demonstrates that CE is a common finding in women complaining of RIF and that common bacteria and mycoplasmas are the most frequently involved infectious agents.\n\nMoreover, this study suggests that hysteroscopy is a useful diagnostic technique in women with RIF as it reliably diagnoses the presence of CE, and makes it possible to evaluate the effectiveness of the antibiotic treatment in restoring a normal hysteroscopic and histologic appearance of the endometrial cavity.\n\nFinally, the reproductive outcome at IVF was significantly improved in those patients in whom antibiotic treatment was able to normalize both hysteroscopic and histologic endometrial pattern.\n\nRegarding the first point, the finding that CE may have a role in the RIF etiology is in accordance with many experimental and clinical papers that underline the role of endometrial inflammation in the etiopathogenesis of RIF (Strandell et al., 1994; F\u00e8ghali et al., 2003; Espinoza et al., 2006; Johnston-MacAnanny et al., 2010).\n\nIndeed, untreated CE has been suggested to diminish the success rates of both spontaneous conception and IVF cycles, as well as to contribute to adverse obstetrical outcomes (F\u00e8ghali et al., 2003; Espinoza et al., 2006).\n\nAccordingly, it is known that the implantation rates at IVF-ET are lower in patients with hydrosalpinx compared with those of couples with unexplained or male sterility.\n\nThis is thought to be related to the leakage of hydrosalpinx fluid, containing leukocytes and inflammatory cytokines, which deteriorate the intrauterine environment and consequently leads to implantation failure (Strandell et al., 1994).\n\nThe prevalence of CE in women with RIF in our study (66.0%) was about double compared with 30.3% reported by Johnston-MacAnanny et al.\n\n(2010).\n\nThis discrepancy could be explained by the very strict selection criteria employed in this study and by the expertise of our group in hysteroscopic and histological diagnosis of CE.\n\nAnyway, we cannot exclude a selection bias due to the retrospective design of the study and the possibility of preferential referral to our center of women in whom a CE was suspected.\n\nWe have also to remark that, in order to rule out any confounding factor and inflammatory conditions, we considered clinical or ultrasonographic evidence of ovarian endometrioma as an exclusion criterion; however, the possibility of peritoneal endometriosis cannot be eliminated completely.\n\nThis may have relevance as recently a close relationship between CE and endometriosis has been demonstrated (Takebayashi et al., 2014).\n\nWe found that common bacteria and mycoplasma are the most frequent etiological agents for CE in women with RIF.\n\nThe high prevalence of common bacteria is not surprising considering the high prevalence of bacterial vaginosis and the knowledge that ascending bacteria can colonize the uterine cavity (Kamiyama et al., 2004; Cicinelli et al., 2012).\n\nIndeed, in IVF cycles the presence of bacterial vaginosis may decrease conception rates, increase early pregnancy losses and may also increase the risk of preterm birth (Salim et al., 2002; Eckert et al., 2003).\n\nThe results also showed that in \u223c29% of cases, Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma urealyticum may be responsible for CE.\n\nThe pathogenic role of Mycoplasma is in accordance with a previous paper reporting the prevalence of U.\n\nurealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis in the endocervix at the time of oocyte collection in women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) (Witkin et al., 1995) and with paper from Haggerty and coworkers who found Mycoplasma genitalium in 12% of cervical specimen and in 8% of endometrial specimen from women affected by non-gonococcal, non-Chlamydia endometritis (Haggerty et al., 2006).\n\nChlamydia was demonstrated in only about 8% of positive endometrial cultures.\n\nOur data are in full accordance with Stern and coworkers who detected the presence of Chlamydia by PCR in only one out of 43 specimens of histologically diagnosed CE, concluding for a limited role, if any, of Chlamydia in the origin of chronic endometritis (Stern et al., 1996).\n\nNo case of N.\n\ngonorrhoeae was found and this is probably due to the specific characteristics of the population studied.\n\nOur study has the intrinsic limitations of all studies that rely on bacteriological cultures of the endometrial cavity using traditional culture techniques and transcervical sampling.\n\nOnly micro-organisms able to grow under conventional microbiology laboratory conditions can be recovered and the procedure may therefore yield biased microbial findings.\n\nThus, it cannot be excluded that other micro-organisms (anaerobic bacteria, viruses, etc.) might also coexist and play a role.\n\nIn our previous paper we observed a significant discordance between the infectious agents found at vaginal and endometrial levels, concluding that the possibility that endometrial results could be biased by vaginal contamination was low (Cicinelli et al., 2009).\n\nMoreover, extreme care was employed during endometrial sampling in order to avoid any contact between the curette and vaginal walls.\n\nFinally, the fact that antibiotic treatment against infectious agent detected at endometrial culture resulted in a normalization of hysteroscopic finding and in a significant improvement in live births rate, speaks in favor of the actual endometrial origin of infectious agents found in endometrial specimens.\n\nThe data of the present paper are in accord with the recent view that uterine cavity is normally not sterile and that presence of micro-organisms does not mean inflammation (Cowling et al., 1992).\n\nHence, it is not just the presence of infectious agents within the internal genital tract but rather the interactions between infectious agents and endometrial environment that is seen today as the most critical issue that determines the presence of pathology (Eckert et al., 2003).\n\nAnother important issue emerging from this study is the importance in women undergoing IVF of performing a careful hysteroscopic evaluation of the uterine cavity in order to detect subtle lesions like CE; this is of particular importance in women with RIF (La Sala et al., 1998; Oliveira et al., 2003; Bohlmann et al., 2010; Bosteels et al., 2010).\n\nThis statement is supported by the improved reproductive outcome that we found in women with RIF, when treatment was able to normalize the hysteroscopic endometrial pattern after an antibiogram guided antibiotic therapy as well as after treatment based on Centers for Disease Control guidelines.\n\nIn fact the clinical PR and the LBR were significantly higher in women of Group 1.\n\nThe implantation rate was different between the two groups with a positive trend for Group 1, even if the difference did not reach statistical significance.\n\nThis data could be explained with the limited number of patients analyzed, but we cannot exclude that treatment of CE could improve the reproductive outcome by preventing adverse obstetrical events without affecting implantation (F\u00e8ghali et al., 2003; Espinoza et al., 2006).\n\nA 61% (28/46) LBR in group 1 after treatment may seem too high.\n\nHowever, the strict selection criteria employed to select a specific subset of women affected by CE and the absence of additional factors interfering with IVF results could concur to explain our results.\n\nA high LBR in a specific subset of patients has been observed elsewhere, in women with RIF with expanded circulating NK and/or NKT-like cells a LBR improvement from 17.9 to 80.0% after intravenous immunoglobulin therapy has been recently demonstrated (Ramos Medina et al., 2014).\n\nRegarding the absence of additional interfering factor with IVF results, old female age, duration of infertility, poor ovarian response, male factor and anovulation as indication for IVF have been reported to represent factors associated with poor outcome at IVF and low LBR compared with women undergoing IVF for unexplained infertility (Battacharya et al., 2013).\n\nAccordingly, the mean age of women in group 1 was 31.7 years, all had a good ovarian reserve and in all cases the indication for IVF was unexplained infertility.\n\nFinally, we have to consider that due to the small number of patients in our study, also the chance factor may play a role in explaining so high results the 95% confidence limits from the binomial distribution for the LBR in group 1 are 45.4\u201374.9. The discrepancy with results of the Johnston-MacAnanny study (Johnston-MacAnanny et al., 2010) in which patients with CE continued to have persistently lower implantation rates despite successful treatment may be partially explained by procedural differences.\n\nIn their study the diagnosis of CE was performed only based on histologic findings without performing either hysteroscopy or endometrial cultures.\n\nHowever, it is known that due to normal presence of leukocytes in the endometrium especially before menstruation, histology may miss the diagnosis of CE (Resta et al., 2012).\n\nNotably, in our series of women with RIF and diagnosed with CE at hysteroscopy, 13 out of 61 (21, 3%) cases positive at both hysteroscopy and histology were negative at cultures.\n\nThis finding may have different explanations and may be related to technical procedures or to the presence of micro-aerophils or anaerobic bacteria which cannot be cultivated with conventional techniques (Haggerty et al., 2006).\n\nThis allows us to speculate that the hysteroscopic evaluation of the endometrial inflammatory disease could have a higher sensitivity than the endometrial cultures in detecting CE, and that a normal endometrial pattern at hysteroscopy could be more accurate in predicting the possibility of a successful pregnancy after IVF.\n\nWhen considering the problem of the cost effectiveness and the risk benefit of our approach to diagnosis and treatment of CE, we underline that fluid mini-hysteroscopy is a minimally invasive technique that can be performed in an office setting without anesthesia (Cicinelli et al., 2008), so that the advantages in terms of diagnosis and treatment amply overcome the costs of the procedure.\n\nMoreover, in case of persistent CE no more than three cycles of treatment were performed so, although we cannot exclude the possibility to generate antibiotic resistance, the potential benefit for patients outweighs the risk.\n\nIn conclusion, even with potential limitations related to retrospective studies, results of this pilot research demonstrate that CE is a condition frequently associated with RIF.\n\nIn our population the most prevalent infectious agents are common bacteria and mycoplasma.\n\nIn women with RIF hysteroscopy reliably detected the existence of CE.\n\nThe normalization of the hysteroscopic endometrial pattern was associated with a significant improvement of the reproductive outcome of the IVF cycle performed after treatment.\n\nHowever, prospective controlled clinical trials are needed to confirm the role of CE in RIF and to evaluate if the antibiotic treatment could actually influence IVF outcomes and improve LBR by restoring the endometrial competence Previous SectionNext Section Authors' roles E.C.

{"content": "AbstractOBJECTIVE: Antibiotics have direct effects on the human intestinal microbiota, particularly in infancy.\n\nAntibacterial agents promote growth in farm animals by unknown mechanisms, but little is known about their effects on human weight gain.\n\nOur aim was to evaluate the impact of antibiotic exposure during infancy on weight and height in healthy Finnish children.METHODS: The population-based cohort comprised 6114 healthy boys and 5948 healthy girls having primary care weight and height measurements and drug purchase data from birth to 24 months.\n\nBMI and height, expressed as z-scores at the median age of 24 months (interquartile range 24 to 26 months), were compared between children exposed and unexposed to antibiotics using analysis of covariance with perinatal factors as covariates.RESULTS: Exposed children were on average heavier than unexposed children (adjusted BMI-for-age z-score difference in boys 0.13 SD [95% confidence interval 0.07 to 0.19, P < .001] and in girls 0.07 SD [0.01 to 0.13, P < .05]).\n\nThe effect was most pronounced after exposure to macrolides before 6 months of age (boys 0.28 [0.11 to 0.46]; girls 0.23 [0.04 to 0.42]) or >1 exposure (boys 0.20 [0.10 to 0.30]; girls 0.13 [0.03 to 0.22]).CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic exposure before 6 months of age, or repeatedly during infancy, was associated with increased body mass in healthy children.\n\nSuch effects may play a role in the worldwide childhood obesity epidemic and highlight the importance of judicious use of antibiotics during infancy, favoring narrow-spectrum antibiotics.anti-bacterial agentsantibioticsbody weightBMIgrowthmicrobiotaoverweightweightheightWhat\u2019s Known on This Subject:Subtherapeutic doses of antibiotics have been used as growth promoters in animal farming since the 1950s.\n\nAntibiotic exposure during infancy is associated with increased body mass in humans.What This Study Adds:The weight-promoting effect of antibiotics is most pronounced when the exposure occurs at <6 months of age or repeatedly during infancy.\n\nIncreased body mass is distinctly associated with exposure to cephalosporins and macrolides, especially in boys.The crucial role of antibiotics in the improvement of human health is unquestionable, but their extended use today has revealed undesirable and unexpected consequences.1,2 Antibiotics have direct intestinal effects, and the link between altered gut microbiota and changes in human metabolism has become clearer.3,4 The intestinal microbiota in infants is particularly vulnerable to perturbation.5 One of the unexpected effects of antibiotics has been their potential ability to promote growth.\n\nThis was first observed in livestock, in which subtherapeutic doses of antibiotics have been widely used for accelerating weight gain since the 1950s.6 In a few recent studies in children, it has been shown that early-life exposure to antibiotics promotes weight gain and increases the risk of obesity.7\u201311 Although these studies provide evidence that antibiotics also promote weight gain in humans, whether this effect is dependent on specific antibiotic type or amount of exposure has been insufficiently explored.In addition to weight gain, linear growth in height may be affected by early antibiotic exposure.\n\nIn children with severe malnutrition or chronic infections such as HIV, several studies have shown that both weight gain and linear growth in height improved with antibiotic therapy.12\u201315 However, the effect of early antibiotic exposure on height in healthy, well-nourished children has not been adequately elucidated.7\u201311In the present population-based study, we aimed to evaluate the impact of antibiotic exposure during the first 24 months of age on weight and height gain in healthy Finnish children carefully screened for other risk factors and chronic conditions potentially affecting linear growth.\n\nAlso, we evaluated the association between early-life antibiotic exposure and the risk of overweight and obesity in the study population.\n\nWe assessed the potential differences between antibiotic types and evaluated the impact of early versus late and single versus repeated exposure.MethodsStudy PopulationIn Finland, child welfare clinics provide regular scheduled visits (12 during the first 24 months of age) covering almost 100% of the child population.16,17 At every visit, primary care nurses perform standardized weight and length/height measurements.\n\nFor the current study, we initially included all children of the Finnish growth reference study population born between Jan.\n\n1, 2003, and April 30, 2007, who attended child welfare clinics in the city of Espoo, Finland and who had \u22651 primary care visit after the age of 24 months (7584 boys and 7180 girls) (Fig 1).18 Espoo is Finland\u2019s second largest city by population, with a significant net migration from all parts of Finland.\n\nIts population has grown >10-fold in the past 60 years.\n\nThe majority of the population (94.4%) is of Finnish origin, which mirrors the whole of Finland (97.3%).19Download figure Open in new tab Download powerpoint FIGURE 1 Flow chart of the exclusion procedure of the study population.To exclude children with possible prenatal conditions affecting growth and control for possible confounding factors statistically, we obtained Birth Register data from the National Institutes of Health and Welfare.\n\nThese data included maternal age, smoking during pregnancy, parental relationship, gestational age, mode of delivery, parity, plurality, birth weight and length, season at birth, and possible congenital syndromes or anomalies.\n\nFirst, 792 boys and 689 girls with congenital syndromes or anomalies (165 boys and 134 girls), with preterm birth before 37 weeks of gestation (354 boys and 275 girls), or lacking birth data (324 boys and 318 girls) were excluded.\n\nSecond, children with diagnosed postnatal growth disorders or regular medication possibly affecting growth (eg, glucocorticoids for asthma) were removed (678 boys and 543 boys).18 The final study population thus comprised 6114 boys and 5948 girls (80.6% and 82.8%, respectively, of the initial study population) (Fig 1).Growth data, from birth to the latest primary care visit after 24 months of age, were collected from the electronic health records.\n\nPotentially false measurements, typing errors, missing values, or duplicated recordings were evaluated by scatter plots and either corrected or excluded.\n\nBMI (calculated as weight [kg]/height [m]2), length/height measurements, and birth size data were transformed into z-scores (BMI-for-age [zBMI] and height-for-age [zHFA]) according to Finnish growth references.18,20 Overweight and obesity were defined by national cutoffs for zBMI18 based on BMI-for-age percentile curves passing through adult values of 25 kg/m2 and 30 kg/m2.21In Finland, antibacterial agents for systemic use are available by prescription only and sold in registered pharmacies.\n\nPurchased medications are reimbursed and registered in the Drug Prescription Register maintained by the Social Insurance Institution of Finland (SII).\n\nInformation on dispensation dates of prescriptions and pharmaceuticals are included in the database.22 According to the annual wholesale statistical database compiled by the Finnish Medicines Agency, from Jan.\n\n1, 2006, to Dec.\n\n31, 2007, the Prescription Register of SII included data of 82% of all the outpatient consumption of antibiotics.\n\nWe extracted information on all systemic antibiotics from the Drug Prescription Register (anatomic-therapeutic-chemical code J01, antibacterials for systemic use, World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology, http://www.whocc.no/atcddd) purchased for the children in the final study population from birth to 24 months of age in primary care.\n\nInformation on antibiotics administered in hospitals was not collected.\n\nThe characteristics of the study population by antibiotic exposure are presented in Supplemental Table 4.\n\nAge at first exposure was categorized into 4 groups: birth to 5 months, 6 to 11 months, 12 to 17 months, and 18 to 23 months.In addition to exposure to any type of antibiotic, 3 specific groups of the most frequently used antibiotics, penicillins (phenoxymethylpenicillin and combination of amoxicillin and clavulanate, anatomic-therapeutic-chemical code J01C), cephalosporins (J01D), and macrolides (J01FA), were analyzed separately.\n\nThe number of separate purchases in the same child was calculated and categorized as none, 1, 2 or 3, and \u22654 episodes (any antibiotic, penicillins) and as none, 1, and \u22652 (cephalosporins, macrolides).Permission for the current study was obtained from Espoo Municipality Institutional Review Board, SII, and the National Institutes of Health and Welfare.\n\nEthical approval was not necessary, because we used only encrypted register data and did not contact the unidentifiable study subjects.Statistical AnalysisWeight and height gain was compared in the exposed and unexposed child population using the covariance analysis method, with random effects for subjects.\n\nBoys and girls were analyzed separately to observe gender-related differences.\n\nThe first height and weight measurements at 24 months of age (or after) were used as the primary end points (expressed as \u226524 months, median [interquartile range] age was 24 [24 to 26] months).\n\nzBMI and zHFA were examined in relation to general exposure (yes/no), age at first exposure (birth to 5 months, 6 to 11 months, 12 to 17 months, and 18 to 23 months), and number of separate exposure episodes.\n\nThe prevalence of perinatal factors possibly interfering with postnatal growth or affecting the exposure to antibiotics (Table 1) were compared by using \u03c72 test.\n\nThose variables that showed statistically significant differences between analyzed groups were used as covariates (P < .05).\n\nThus, statistical adjustments were performed with maternal smoking after the first trimester, parental relationship, mode of delivery, birth weight, and birth length for boys and maternal smoking after the first trimester, mode of delivery, and birth weight for girls.View this table:View inline View popup TABLE 1 Perinatal Factors Potentially Associated With Weight Status at \u226524 Months of Age or With Antibiotic Exposure in InfancyThe relationship between antibiotic exposure before the age of 24 months and the risk of overweight \u226524 months was analyzed using logistic regression.\n\nThe magnitude of the associations was quantified using adjusted odds ratio (aOR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).Data were analyzed by using SPSS software (version 19, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY).\n\nP values <.05 were considered statistically significant.ResultsChildren who received systemic antibiotics during infancy were on average heavier than unexposed children at the age of \u226524 months (Table 2).\n\nUnadjusted and adjusted differences of mean zBMI were 0.13 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.20, P < .001) and 0.13 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.19, P < .001), respectively, for boys and 0.08 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.14, P < .01) and 0.07 (0.01 to 0.13, P < .05) for girls.\n\nExposed boys at the age of \u226524 months were also slightly taller than unexposed boys (zHFA 0.08, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.14, P < .01) without adjustment, whereas no difference was observed in girls or in adjusted heights in boys.View this table:View inline View popup TABLE 2 Characteristics of the Study Population in Relation to Exposure to Antibiotics at <24

differences were in those who had been exposed to antibiotics at 12 to 17 months (0.08 [0.00 to 0.15]).Download figure Open in new tab Download powerpoint FIGURE 2 Adjusted differences of means (95%

adjustments: Maternal smoking after first trimester, parental relationships, mode of delivery, birth weight and birth length for boys; Maternal smoking after first trimester, mode of delivery and birth weight for girls.The most pronounced associations were observed between macrolide exposure at any age <24 months and higher zBMI (from 0.28 [0.11 to 0.46] at <6 months to 0.23 [0.12 to 0.35] at 18 to 23 months) (Fig 2).\n\nIn girls, macrolide exposure at <6 months was associated with mean zBMI difference 0.23 (0.04 to 0.42).\n\nAge at first exposure to any antibiotics (12 to 17 months), penicillins (12 to 17 months), cephalosporins (18 to 23 months), and macrolides (6 to 11) months was significantly associated with changes in height for boys (Fig 2).\n\nExposure to any antibiotics and penicillins at 6 to 11 months of age resulted in similar tendencies for girls.Number of Antibiotic Exposures in Infancy and GrowthIn boys, multiple courses of antibiotics before the age of 24 months increased zBMI score (Fig 3).\n\nAdjusted difference of mean zBMI to unexposed children was 0.09 (95% CI \u22120.00 to 0.18) in those exposed once, 0.10 (0.02 to 0.18) in those exposed 2 or 3 times, and 0.18 (0.10 to 0.26) in those exposed \u22654 times to any antibiotics.\n\nThere was a linear trend in the number of antibiotic exposures (P < .001).\n\nMultiexposed girls (\u22654 times) were also on average heavier (0.13 [0.06 to 0.20]) than unexposed girls, and their zBMI increased with the number of exposures as well (P < .001).\n\nThe most pronounced difference in mean zBMI between exposed and unexposed children at the age of \u226524 months was found for boys (0.20 [0.10 to 0.30]) having \u22652 exposures to macrolides or girls (0.17 [0.05 to 0.29]) having \u22652 exposures to cephalosporins.Download figure Open in new tab Download powerpoint FIGURE 3 Adjusted differences of means (95% CI) for zBMI and zHFA at the median age of 24 months according to the

taller on average (0.14 [0.03 to 0.25]).Risk of OverweightAt the age of \u226524 months, 1 of every 5 boys and 1 of every 10 girls was overweight or obese (Table 1).\n\nThe risk of being overweight was significantly associated with earlier antibiotic exposure and increasing number of separate antibiotic courses in boys, but not in girls (Table 3).\n\nThe aOR was 1.34 (95% CI 1.06 to 1.66) in boys and 1.16 (0.87 to 1.56) in girls when the first antibiotic exposure took place at <6 months of age.\n\nFour or more courses of antibiotics resulted in aOR 1.27 (1.04 to 1.55) in boys and 1.19 (0.96 to 1.48) in girls.\n\naOR was 1.65 (1.09 to 2.31) for boys who were exposed to macrolides at <6 months (Table 3).View this table:View inline View popup TABLE 3 Odds of Becoming Overweight at the Age of 24 Months According to Age at First Exposure to Antibiotics and Number of Exposures <24 MonthsDiscussionIn this population-based study with 12 062 healthy children, we showed that antibiotic exposure in infancy is independently associated with enhanced growth, in both weight and height, at the age of 24 months.\n\nThe first exposure before the age of 6 months or repeatedly during the first 23 months of age had the largest effect on BMI.\n\nOverall, infant boys were exposed to antibiotics significantly earlier and more frequently than girls, and the growth-promoting effect of antibiotics was also more pronounced in boys.\n\nIn addition, exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics such as macrolides showed the most pronounced effects on growth.Severely malnourished infants have been shown to gain weight faster when they are given antibiotics,12\u201315 and similar findings have been only recently reported in well-nourished children in affluent Western countries.7\u201311 Antibiotics increase body fat mass in mice, which is assumed to result from changes in composition of the intestinal microbial flora.23,24 In these experimental murine studies, the effect of antibiotics was shown not only to be dependent on the increase in the energy intake or hormonal changes that regulate satiety but also was associated with alterations in the expression of microbial genes, which contribute to the conversion of carbohydrates to short-chain fatty acids.23,24 Thus, more efficient energy harvesting in the colon is assumed to decrease energy loss in the stools.\n\nA similar mechanism might be true in humans as well, and the growth promotion associated with antibiotic exposure shown in this study and in previous studies could be linked to these intestinal changes.\n\nOf note, in a recent study, a more pronounced growth-promoting effect of antibiotic exposure was reported in male than female mice.25The strength of our study, in comparison with previous studies, is that the child population was carefully screened for other potential factors that might alter growth.\n\nThese individuals were excluded, and statistical adjustment was made for birth size and perinatal factors.\n\nAlso, the growth data are based on standardized measurements performed by educated nurses.\n\nGrowth data were based on self-measurements in 2 previous studies,7,11 and Trasande et al pooled both genders in 1 group.9 It is noteworthy that the data of Bailey et al were not adjusted for perinatal factors.10 In addition, 3 of 5 previous studies in well-nourished children were based on medication data obtained from questionnaires,7,9,11 and 1 on data from medical records.10 In our study, as well as in that of Azad et al,8 the use of antibiotics was collected from the medication registries.\n\nOur data based on medicine purchases probably reflects real use better than data for prescribed medications, in which primary noncompliance is not taken into account.26 The results of our study suggest that the growth-promotion effect of antibiotic exposure might be different in males and females.\n\nThis is consistent with the recent studies of Azad et al8 and Murphy et al.11 However, Azad et al had a relatively small sample size and large number of dropouts,8 and the growth data of Murphy et al were not converted into z-scores,11 and therefore it still remains unknown how exact the observed gender difference was.\n\nThere might also be some other, as yet unexplored, mechanisms explaining the more pronounced effects of antibiotics on growth in boys.To our knowledge, ours is the first study to report the effects of antibiotic exposure in growth in height in Western countries.7\u201311 Linear growth seems to be affected especially after repeated exposure to antibiotics, when the increase in weight is also the most pronounced.\n\nIncrease in weight in early childhood often also leads to acceleration in growth in height, which therefore may be an event secondary to weight gain after multiple antibiotic exposures in infancy.\n\nHowever, the prevalent use of antibiotics in early infancy might also contribute to the secular change in height observed in Western countries in the past decades,27 since even minor bacterial infections would have at least a transient suppressive effect on growth if left untreated;28 thus the growth-promotion effect of antibiotics during infancy might be supported in this finding.We found that growth-promotion effects varied between different types of antibiotics, and that macrolides had the most pronounced weight-increasing effect in children.\n\nThe impact of macrolides may be due to their pharmacokinetics.\n\nUnlike amoxicillin and cephalosporins, which are eliminated by the kidneys and most likely have very little direct contact with the colonic microbiota, macrolides are excreted in bile and participate in the enterohepatic cycle, which may explain this specific difference from other antibiotics.\n\nOur finding was at least partially in line with the results by Bailey et al,10 even though they were only grouped into narrow-spectrum (penicillins) and broad-spectrum (cephalosporins and macrolides) antibiotics.We confirmed earlier observations that the use of antibiotics in infancy is associated with the risk of being overweight in boys.\n\nIn our study, girls did not have a statistically significant risk for being overweight, which can be explained by the generally lower risk of overweight in girls.\n\nHowever, the worldwide obesity epidemic is real,29,30 and among Finnish adolescents, for instance, the prevalence of being overweight has almost doubled in the past 2 decades31 and is more pronounced for boys.18,31 An increase in the use of antibiotics could be an additional contributing factor to the development of excess weight problems.10,24A limitation of our study is the lack of data regarding some potential confounders that may have influenced the growth of the children, such as maternal weight and paternal data.\n\nHowever, in the subgroup of children with known maternal BMI before pregnancy (3551 boys and 3470 girls), the difference of adjusted mean zBMI (95% CI) between children that were exposed and not exposed to antibiotics at <6 months was 0.12 (0.01 to 0.24) in boys and 0.07 (\u22120.04 to 0.19) in girls (Supplemental Fig 4).\n\nThus, the results of our study are not likely to be biased even though analyses were performed without maternal BMI as a covariate.\n\nPaternal factors probably had a more minor influence on offspring growth compared with maternal factors.7 Limitations of this study also include the lack of data on intrapartum antibiotics (eg, prophylactic dosing before cesarean section) and breastfeeding.Children in our study received antibiotics for various indications, which were not included in the database.\n\nIn Finland, antibiotics are mostly prescribed to this age group to treat respiratory infections,32 which are not expected to influence the intestinal microbiota directly.\n\nIn addition, gastrointestinal infections, which are mostly viral and treated with fluid therapy, are only exceptionally a reason for antibiotic use in Finland.32ConclusionsAntibiotic exposure at the age of <6 months or repeatedly during infancy has an increasing effect on body mass and height at 24 months of age in healthy children.\n\nExposure to macrolides seems to have the most pronounced effect on body composition.\n\nSuch effects on growth may have played a role in the childhood obesity epidemic worldwide.\n\nThese results highlight the importance of critical use of antibiotics in early infancy, favoring narrow-spectrum antibiotics and avoiding repeated exposure when possible.FootnotesAccepted January 26, 2015.Address correspondence to Antti Saari, Kuopio University Hospital, PO Box 1777, FIN-70200 Kuopio, Finland.\n\nE-mail: antti.saari{at}kuh.fiDrs Saari,

{"content": "AbstractThe development of reliable methods for restoring susceptibility after antibiotic resistance arises has proven elusive.\n\nA greater understanding of the relationship between antibiotic administration and the evolution of resistance is key to overcoming this challenge.\n\nHere we present a data-driven mathematical approach for developing antibiotic treatment plans that can reverse the evolution of antibiotic resistance determinants.\n\nWe have generated adaptive landscapes for 16 genotypes of the TEM \u03b2-lactamase that vary from the wild type genotype \u201cTEM-1\u201d through all combinations of four amino acid substitutions.\n\nWe determined the growth rate of each genotype when treated with each of 15 \u03b2-lactam antibiotics.\n\nBy using growth rates as a measure of fitness, we computed the probability of each amino acid substitution in each \u03b2-lactam treatment using two different models named the Correlated Probability Model (CPM) and the Equal Probability Model (EPM).\n\nWe then performed an exhaustive search through the 15 treatments for substitution paths leading from each of the 16 genotypes back to the wild type TEM-1.\n\nWe identified optimized treatment paths that returned the highest probabilities of selecting for reversions of amino acid substitutions and returning TEM to the wild type state.\n\nFor the CPM model, the optimized probabilities ranged between 0.6 and 1.0.

eukaryotes), we are vastly outnumbered by bacteria in nearly all measures, including total population size, biomass, genetic diversity, emigration, and immigration [1]; 2) bacteria can use horizontal gene transfer to share resistance genes across distantly related species of bacteria, including non-pathogens [2]; 3) compared to humans, bacteria have relatively few vulnerable target sites [3]; 4) microbes are the sources of nearly all antibiotics that are used by humans [4].\n\nGiven the overwhelming numbers of bacteria, the limited number of target sites, the numerous ways that they can infect humans, and that they have been exposed to naturally occurring antibiotics for billions of years, resistance to antibiotics used by human populations is unavoidable.\n\nOnce resistance is present in a bacterial population, it is exceedingly difficult to remove for several reasons.\n\nIf any amount of antibiotic is present in the environment, antibiotic resistance genes will confer a large fitness advantage [5], and even when antibiotics are not present in an environment, the fitness costs for carrying and expressing resistance genes are small to non-existent [6].\n\nIn addition to it being difficult to remove antibiotics from the environment [7], even if humans were to completely abandon the use of antibiotics, resistance would persist for years [8].\n\nEfforts to remove resistance genes from clinical environments by either discontinuing or reducing the use of specific antibiotics for some period of time, either through general reduction of antibiotic consumption or periodic rotations of antibiotics (cycling) have not worked in any reliable or reproducible manner [9]; indeed it would have been surprising if they had worked [10],[11].\n\nSince antibiotic resistance is unavoidable, it only makes sense to accept its inevitability and develop methods for mitigating the consequences.\n\nOne reasonable approach is to rotate the use of antibiotics.\n\nThis has been implemented in many ways and there are recent studies to model the optimal duration, mixing versus cycling, and how relaxed antibiotic cycles may be and still function as planned [12, 13].\n\nHowever, none of those models have focused on developing a method for designing an optimal succession of antibiotics.\n\nIn a previous publication [14], we proposed that susceptibility to antibiotics could be restored by rotating consumption of multiple antibiotics that are a) structurally similar, b) inhibit/kill bacteria through the same target site, and c) result in pleiotropic fitness costs that reduce the overall resistance of bacteria to each other.\n\nWe presented a proof-of-principle example [14] of how this might work with a series of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics in which some of them would select for new amino acid substitutions in the TEM \u03b2-lactamase and others that would select reversions in TEM ultimately leading back to the wild type (un-mutated) state.\n\nWe have focused particularly on \u03b2-lactamases because there is often no fitness cost associated with their expression, and they are particularly difficult to remove from clinical microbial populations.\n\nOur current work seeks to identify \u03b2-lactam treatment plans that have the highest probability of returning a population expressing a small number of variant TEM genotypes to the wild type state.\n\nThe wild type TEM-1, and a handful of its descendants, confers resistance to penicillins alone.\n\nHowever, most of the descendants confer resistance to either cephalosporins or penicillins combined with \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors (inhibitor resistance), and a few confer resistance to both.\n\nOf the 194 clinically identified TEM genotypes that encode unique amino acid sequences [15], 174 (89.7%) differ from the wild type TEM-1 by at most four amino acid substitutions (see Table 1).\n\nOur choice of a system that includes four amino acid substitutions is based upon an apparent threshold for amino acid substitutions among functional TEM genotypes.\n\nThe rarity of the co-existence of cephalosporin resistance and inhibitor resistance and the fact that no single substitution confers both phenotypes suggested that sign epistasis (i.e. reversals of substitutions from beneficial to detrimental) exists as the substitutions that contribute to this dual phenotype are combined.\n\nWe have assumed that substitutions arise according to the strong selection weak mutation model (SSWM) [16] in which single substitutions reach fixation before the next substitution occurs.\n\nRecent work [17] in addition to past phylogenetic analysis [18] and competition experiments [19] suggest that this is a valid model for TEM evolution.\n\nDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG

favor reversions of substitutions within an evolved TEM genotype would increase the number of antibiotics that could be used.\n\nTo embark upon our effort of determining the best way to do this, we decided to create a model system based upon the TEM-50 genotype, which differs from TEM-1 by four amino acid substitutions.\n\nAll four substitutions by themselves confer clearly defined resistance advantages in the presence of certain antibiotics.\n\nAdditionally, TEM-50 is one of the few genotypes that simultaneously confers resistance to cephalosporins and inhibitor combined therapies.\n\nResults From experimental data to mathematical models We created all 16 variant genotypes of the four amino acid substitutions found in TEM-50 using site directed mutagenesis (Table 2) and measured the growth rates of 12 replicates of E.coli DH5\u03b1-E expressing each genotype in the presence of one of fifteen \u03b2-lactam antibiotics (Table 3).\n\nEach genotype was grown in each antibiotic in 12 replicates.\n\nWe computed the mean growth rate of those replicates (Table 4) and the variance of each sample, as well as the significance between adjacent genotypes that differed by one amino acid substitution.\n\nThis was done using one-way ANOVA analysis.\n\nDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Table 2.\n\nVariant Genotypes Created, Binary

red.\n\nWe rank ordered the genotypes (Table 5) in each landscape diagram with a score from 1 to 16, with the genotype promoting the fastest growth receiving a score of \u201c1\u201d and the genotype with the slowest growth a score of \u201c16\u201d.\n\nThis analysis shows that all genotypes have a score of 5 or better and a score of 13 or worse, in at least one landscape, indicating that there is abundant pleiotropy as antibiotic selective pressures change.\n\nThat pleiotropy provides a basis for effectively alternating antibiotic to restore the wild type.\n\nDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG

the 15 antibiotics previously mentioned in Table 3: AMP, AM, CEC, CTX, ZOX, CXM, CRO, AMC, CAZ, CTT, SAM, CPR, CPD, TZP, and FEP and their interactions with a bi-allelic 4-locus TEM system {0,1}4 where four functionally important amino acid residues involved in the evolution of TEM-50 are considered.\n\nThe number \"1\" denotes an amino acid substitution, whereas \"0\" denotes no substitution at the site.\n\nWe experimentally determined growth rates for all genotypes in our TEM system at a selected concentration of each antibiotic.\n\nThose growth rates depend upon the states of the four amino acid residues.\n\nThe growth rates for all genotypes in one antibiotic can be represented by a real 2\u00d72\u00d72\u00d72 tensor f = (fijkl), where f(ar) is the fitness landscape for the antibiotic r.\n\nWe can identify f(ar) with a vector whose coordinates are indexed by {0,1}4.\n\nThe resulting 15 vectors, one for each antibiotic, are the rows in Table 4.\n\nOur substitution model M(f) is a function that assigns a transition matrix to each fitness landscape.\n\nThe rows and columns of M(f) are labeled by the genotypes {0,1}4 according to the degree lexicographic order.\n\nThe entries in M(f(ar))u,v represent the probability that that genotype u is replaced by genotype v under the presence of antibiotic ar.\n\nFor that reason, the rows of our transition matrices have nonnegative entries and their rows sum to 1.\n\nWe require that our transition matrices respect the adjacency structure of the 4-cube, that is, M(f)u,v = 0 unless u and v are vectors in {0,1}4 that differ in at most one coordinate.\n\nIn other words, we reasoned that resistant strains are most likely to be in competition with those that express resistance genotypes that are immediately adjacent (vary by a single amino acid substitution).\n\nThe combined effect of a sequence a1,\u2026,ak of k antibiotics is described by a new transition matrix obtained as the product of the transition matrices for each drug.\n\nFor any genotype u other than 0000, our goal is to find a sequence of antibiotics which maximizes the probability of returning to the wild type.\n\nIn other words, if we restrict to sequences of length k our goal is to find a sequence of antibiotics a1,\u2026,ak which maximizes the matrix entry M(f(a1))\u00b7M(f(a2))\u00b7\u2026\u00b7M(f(ak))u,0000.\n\nFor each u this requires searching over all 15k antibiotic sequences of length k.\n\nFinding optimal sequences of antibiotics We used two substitution models to determine the optimal (highest probability) sequences of \u03b2-lactams for returning TEM genotypes back to their wild type state.\n\nBriefly, the Correlated Probability Model (CPM) allows probabilities to be based upon the actual growth rates.\n\nIt is given by applying Eq (3) to the growth rates in Table 4.\n\nThe Equal Probability Model (EPM) assumes that beneficial substitutions are equally likely and that only the direction of the arrows in Figs 1\u201315 is important.\n\nThis means that the matrix entry M(f)u,v is 1/N if genotype u has N outgoing arrows and there is an arrow from u to v.\n\nA visual summary of the highest probabilities according to the CPM is provided in Fig 16.\n\nThe CPM provides good estimates if fitness differences between genotypes are small [14, 22\u201324].\n\nThe EPM has been used in settings where only rank order (as in Table 5) is available [25].\n\nDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Fig 16.\n\nSummary of CPM Substitutions with the Highest Probabilities.Each arrow is labeled by the drug or drugs corresponding to the maximal transition probability, taken over all 15 drugs.\n\nEach arrow is also labeled by the maximal probability.\n\nThe top panel shows which antibiotics selected the addition of substitutions and the bottom panel shows which antibiotics selected reversions.\n\nUnlabled arrows are those with low probabilities across all antibiotics.\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0122283.g016From the graph, it is possible to find candidate treatment plans.\n\nFor example, when starting at genotype 1010 the graph shows that the probability for ending at 0000 is 0.71for the sequence ZOX-TZP (0.71 is the product of the arrow labels).\n\nSimilarly, when starting at 1111 the probability for ending at 0000 is 0.62 for the sequence CEC-CAZ-TZP-AM.\n\nWhen starting at 0001 the graphs shows that a single drug gives probability at most 0.29, whereas the probability for ending at 0000 for the sequence AMC-CRO-AM (one arrow up, two arrows down) is at least 0.96\u00b70.62 = 0.6. This graph can also be used to generate treatment paths that start and end at the same genotype, making possible the development of a fixed treatment plan.\n\nFor example, from a starting point 0000, the probability for ending at 0000 is 0.62 for the sequence: CEC-CTX-ZOX-CPD-CPR-CAZ-TZP-AM For all sequences of antibiotics of a fixed length (two, three, four, five, and six), we examined the probability that a given genotype is returned to the wild type state.\n\nIt is worth noting that within these paths, a single genotype can be repeated consecutively with different antibiotics, thus making it possible to have an odd number of steps in the treatment paths when an even number of subtitutions are introduced.\n\nFor every starting genotype, we found we were able to return to the wild type genotype with a probability between 0.6 and 1.0 when using the CPM model and a probability of 0.375 and 1.0 when using the EPM model.\n\nThese results are summarized in Tables 6\u20139 and Fig 17.\n\nThese results show the number of paths and their probabilities (Tables 6 and 7) and the substitutions selected through the optimal treatment plans (Tables 8\u201311) for returning to the wild type state from various starting points.\n\nDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Fig 17.\n\nSummary of Optimal 6 Step CPM and EPM Treatment Paths beginning at

through amino acid substitution, but then rapidly return bacteria to the wild type state (Table 12 and Fig 18).\n\nSuch cycles were possible for path length of two, four, and six and the probabilities of those paths were respectively 0.704, 0.617, 0.617.\n\nWe found that in the most probable cases, the genotype varied by only one amino acid substitution before reverting back to the wild type state.\n\nHowever, when treatment plans with lower probabilities are considered, we find that more amino acid substitutions in the genotype are allowed.\n\nDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger

and Associated \u03b2-lactam Antibiotics.\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0122283.t012 DiscussionIn this study, we have developed an experimental approach for measuring pleiotropy and a computational mathematical approach for optimizing antibiotic treatment paths.\n\nThe experimental approach we developed is rapid and high throughput, consistent with previous work [26], and should be applicable to many species of resistant bacteria.\n\nThe mathematical model we created expresses the problem of antibiotic resistance in general terms, and can therefore be applied to other resistance phenotypes where pleiotropy occurs to identify the antibiotic treatment plans that have the highest probability of reversing the evolution of resistance.\n\nThe purpose of this study was to determine whether it is possible to use selective pressures to return TEM-genotypes to the wild type state, as observed in 1963 when TEM-1 was originally isolated.\n\nThe methods may also be used to select for any particular genotype within our data set.\n\nAs such, we may select with reasonably high probabilities, resistance genotypes that existed at some prior point in time.\n\nTo highlight this feature, we have named our software package \u201cTime Machine\u201d.\n\nOnce given growth rates of adjacent genotypes, Time Machine returned treatment plans that restored the wild type state as observed in 1963 with probabilities greater than 0.6 when using the CPM model and greater than 3/8 (>0.375) when using EPM.\n\nThese results suggest that when possible it is desirable to use actual growth rates rather than rough ranking data.\n\nWhile these treatment methods may have clinical value, we have yet to determine the ideal duration of each therapy.\n\nAdditionally the antibiotics included in our study may have different applications in the clinic.\n\nA further issue is that if new genotypes arise, the treatment plan may fail.\n\nThe inclusion of more resistance genes in this type of approach may aid in the creation of robust treatment plans that are effective even when unexpected genotypes arise.\n\nThe discrete optimization problem motivated by our goal to reverse resistance, or the challenge to build a better time machine, is of independent mathematical interest.\n\nTables 6 and 7 suggest that the maximum probabilities in each row stagnate after a limited number of steps.\n\nThis is not always the case.\n\nWe have created an example (see supplemental information) of two substitution matrices on a 3-locus system where the maximum probabilities can be increased indefinitely (S1 Fig).\n\nThese results show that great potential exists for remediation of antibiotic resistance through antibiotic treatment plans when pleiotropic fitness costs are known for an appropriate set of antibiotics.\n\nWhile developed using a model of Gram-negative antibacterial resistance, this approach could also be used for Gram-positive bacteria and HIV treatment plans.\n\nMethods Experimental methods Strains and Cultures.We expressed 16 mutant constructs of the blaTEM gene in plasmid pBR322 from strain DH5-\u03b1E.\n\nThe 16 genotypes differ at all combinations of four amino acid residues and have been previously described [14].\n\nWe grew them overnight (16 hours) in standing cultures and diluted them to a concentration of 1.9X105 as described elsewhere [14].\n\nWe transferred 80 \u03bcl of each culture to a 384-well plate with one genotype present in each of the 16 rows.\n\nThe first 12 wells of each row were antibiotic free (controls) and the last 12 wells contained a single antibiotic at an inhibitory, sublethal concentration.\n\nWe tested many concentrations and used those that maximized our ability to make comparisons between alleles.\n\nAfter plating, a membrane is placed over the plate and simultaneously incubated/measured in the Eon Microplate Spectrophotometer at a temperature of 25.1\u00b0C for 22 hours.\n\nThis relatively cool (<37\u00b0) temperature is used because degradation of the antibiotics is much slower, while the growth rate of the bacteria is still sufficient to capture the complete exponential period of growth over the duration of the experiment.\n\nOverall, we have found that a temperature ~25\u00b0C yields more reliable and consistent measurement of growth rates in the presence of antibiotics.\n\nMeasurements of cell density (light scattering) at a wavelength of 600 nanometers were automatically collected every 20 minutes after brief agitation to homogenize and oxygenate the culture.\n\nGrowth Rates.The data obtained from the microplate spectrophotometer is exported to the GrowthRates program to derive the growth rates.\n\nIn essence, by measuring the optical density at frequent intervals the GrowthRates program can estimate the growth rate,\u03b1, through a linear regression algorithm fitting the data from the exponential growth phase.\n\nDetails can be found in [27] in the section entitled \u201cThe Growth Curve\u201d located on pages 233\u20134.\n\nThere is not a direct or simple correlation between this method and other methods such as minimum inhibitory (MIC) or disk diffusion testing.\n\nThe output of this program for the data we collected was a list f(a1),f(a2),\u2026,f(ak) of 15 tensors, each of format 2\u00d72\u00d72\u00d72.\n\nThese are the rows in Table 4.\n\nSo if u \u220a {0,1}4 is a genotype, then f(ai)u is the fitness of genotype u in the presence of antibiotic ai.\n\nThis fitness is a growth rate, so we are here using the letter f for a quantity often denoted by \u03b1.\n\nOne-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was then used to compare the means of the growth rates obtained, and to determine if there were significant differences between the growth rates of adjacent genotypes.\n\nCorrelated Probability Model (CPM): Once the growth rates have been determined under various experimental conditions, the next step is to use them to compute fixation probabilities.\n\nIf the (multiplicative) absolute fitnesses Wu and Wv of two neighboring genotypes u and v, differ by a small quantity then the (additive) relative fitness can be approximated by 1 where T is the generation time.\n\nUsing a Taylor series approximation, 2 If Wv > Wu, then 3 is the probability for v to substitute u, where uj are the neighbors of u with higher fitness than u [23].\n\nEqual Probability Model (EPM): According to the EPM model, the probabilities are equal for all beneficial substitutions, so that one needs the fitness graphs only for computing the probabilities.\n\nThe matrix entry M(f)u,v is 1/N if genotype u has N outgoing arrows and there is an arrow from u to v.\n\nCPM is accurate if fitness differences between genotypes are small, while EPM may provide better estimates if fitness differences are substantial.\n\nIndeed, if the fitness effects of all available beneficial mutants exceed some threshold, then fixation probabilities are independent of fitness values [28].\n\nWe applied both CPM and EPM, since no complete theory for substitution probabilities exists.\n\nAdditionally, comparison of two models is useful in learning how sensitive our results are for variation in substitution probabilities.\n\nTime Machine Programs.Optimal antibiotic sequences and pathways of genotypes: Let M(f(a)) denote the 16\u00d716 transition matrix we derived for the antibiotic labeled a (S1 File EPM Prepare and S2 File CPM Prepare).\n\nFor any sequence a1,a2,\u2026ak of k antibiotics, we consider the matrix product M(f(a1))M(f(a2))M(f(a3)).\n\nThis product is also a 16\u00d716 transition matrix.\n\nIts entry in row u and column v is the fixation probability of genotype u mutating to genotype v under the antibiotic sequence a1,a2,\u2026,ak.\n\nThat probability is a sum of products of entries in the individual matrices M(f(ai)), with one sum for each possible pathway of genotypes from u to v.\n\nThe Time Machine enumerates all 15k antibiotic sequences of length k, and it selects all sequences that maximize the entry in row u and column v of the matrix product (S3 File EPM Run and S4 File CPM Run).\n\nIn a subsequent step we then analyze these optimal antibiotic sequences, and for each such sequence, we extract the full list of genotype pathways that contribute (S5 File EPM Out and S6 File CPM Out).\n\nWe implemented this algorithm in the computer algebra software Maple, and we ran it for k = 2,3,4,5,6.\n\nThe running time of the program is slow because of the exponential growth in the number of sequences.\n\nAt present we do not know whether an efficient algorithm exists for solving our optimization problem for larger values of k.\n\nCycles of antibiotics: We also used this method to compute cyclical treatment paths in which the starting and ending genotypes were the wild type 0000 (S7 File EPM CyclingOut and S8 File CPM CyclingOut).\n\nThe problem we solved was somewhat different from the previous one, in that we focused on obtaining the maximal probabilities of a cycle that includes some substitutions and then returns to the wild type without halting.\n\nHalting means that adjacent genotypes in a mutational pathway coincide, which is undesirable.\n\nSupporting InformationS1 Fig.\n\nLocus Model.For any biallelic system and set of drugs, the maximum probabilities for returning to the wild-type depend on how many steps one allows in the treatment plan.\n\nThe following example demonstrates that the maximum probabilities may increase by the number of steps indefinitely.\n\nConsider a three-loci system where the genotypes are ordered as 000; 100; 010; 001; 110; 101; 011; 111: Assume that the starting point is the genotype 100 and that Drugs A and B (see the next page) are available.\n\nFor the sequence A, the probability for ending at 000 is 0.9, for A-B-A 0.99, for A-B-A-B-A 0.999, and so forth.\n\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0122283.s001(TIFF) S1 File.\n\nEPM Prepare.File used to convert growth rate averages into data matrices.\n\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0122283.s002(TXT) S2

{"content": "AbstractHigh antibiotic resistance frequencies have become a major public health issue.\n\nThe decrease in new antibiotics' production, combined with increasing frequencies of multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria, cause substantial limitations in treatment options for some bacterial infections.\n\nTo diminish overall resistance, and especially the occurrence of bacteria that are resistant to all antibiotics, certain drugs are deliberately scarcely used\u2014mainly when other options are exhausted.\n\nWe use a mathematical model to explore the efficiency of such antibiotic restrictions.\n\nWe assume two commonly used drugs and one restricted drug.\n\nThe model is examined for the mixing strategy of antibiotic prescription, in which one of the drugs is randomly assigned to each incoming patient.\n\nData obtained from Rabin medical center, Israel, is used to estimate realistic single and double antibiotic resistance frequencies in incoming patients.\n\nWe find that broad usage of the hitherto restricted drug can reduce the number of incorrectly treated patients, and reduce the spread of bacteria resistant to both common antibiotics.\n\nSuch double resistant infections are often eventually treated with the restricted drug, and therefore are prone to become resistant to all three antibiotics.\n\nThus, counterintuitively, a broader usage of a formerly restricted drug can sometimes lead to a decrease in the emergence of bacteria resistant to all drugs.\n\nWe recommend re-examining restriction of specific drugs, when multiple resistance to the relevant alternative drugs already exists.\n\nAuthor Summary Methods for minimizing antibiotic resistance are becoming more important as antibiotic resistance frequencies are rising, coupled with low discovery rates of new antibiotics.\n\nIn this work we examined the practice of restricting specific drugs to be used only as 'last resort'.\n\nThe goal of such restrictions is to maintain low resistance levels to certain drugs, and prevent the creation of bacteria resistant to all available treatment options.\n\nWe used a mathematical model to study the impact of such restrictions, when some resistance to the unrestricted drugs is already present.\n\nWe estimated the resistance frequencies of common bacteria from hospital data.\n\nWe find that restricting drugs leads to increased

pathogenic bacteria [2,3], entailing higher risk for patients and increased economic costs [4,5].\n\nEspecially perilous are infections of multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria, which can lead to higher rates of inadequate treatment and mortality [6\u20138], and at times are resistant to almost all available antibiotics [9,10].\n\nEven drugs of last resort, with relatively low prescription rate, are revealed to have increasing resistance frequencies [11,12].\n\nThe increase in antibiotic resistance frequencies is a consequence of microbial evolution and adaptation, induced by vast anthropogenic antibiotic consumption and dissemination [13].\n\nThis arms-race hinges on two main forces, acting at opposite directions: resistance acquisition and spread in bacterial populations, and new antibiotic production [14].\n\nSeeing that rates of new antibiotics' production are steadily decreasing [15] (although efforts are made to motivate the development of new antibiotics [16,17]), we are left to consider measures to impede the emergence of new resistant, and particularly MDR, bacteria.\n\nReducing superfluous antibiotic usage, both in human consumption and veterinary usage, is currently considered the prominent course of action [18,19].\n\nAlbeit the benefit of reducing overall superfluous antibiotic usage is easy to justify and seems to have almost no drawbacks; restricting specific antimicrobial agents involves a compromise between increasing resistance to a drug saved for the most acute scenarios, versus increasing the probability of correct treatment.\n\nThe rationale of restricting specific drugs is an evolutionary one.\n\nThe use of a certain antibiotic exerts selective pressure on microbes to acquire resistance to that antibiotic.\n\nHowever, restricting an antibiotic does not amount to complete avoidance of its usage, as it will still be used against infections resistant to all other antibiotics [20].\n\nThus an increase in the frequency of bacteria resistant to the common antibiotics might result in increased usage of the restricted antibiotic as well.\n\nRecent theoretical studies support these claims: Wu et al.\n\nhave shown that maintaining variation in stockpiled influenza drugs might substantially reduce resistance [21], while Joyner et al.\n\ndemonstrated the benefits of developing new antibiotics and expanding the range of possible antimicrobial treatments [22].\n\nIn this work we try to assess the conditions under which a restricted antibiotic agent should be considered for broader usage.\n\nWe use a mathematical model to describe the dynamics of antibiotic resistance within a hospital unit.\n\nWe model three antibiotics effective against a bacterial pathogen, and bacterial strains with all combinations of resistance to these antibiotics.\n\nWe concentrate on a scenario where two antibiotics are more frequently used than a third one.\n\nTherefore resistance levels to the first two antibiotics are high, while the third antibiotic has thus far been restricted to emergency use only, and the level of resistance against it is lower.\n\nThis is compatible with 'last resort' antibiotics such as Vancomycin, Linezolid and Daptomycin.\n\nWe compare the efficiency of antibiotic appliance strategies where one of the antibiotics is restricted, to strategies where all drugs are equally applied.\n\nWe examine the impact of antibiotics restriction in the context of a commonly used antibiotic prescription strategy: mixing, wherein each drug is prescribed to each patient with equal probability [23\u201325].\n\nSeveral works have compared mixing and other strategies [23\u201327].\n\nHere, we focus on a different question: the potential effect of restricting antibiotics on multi drug resistance within the framework of mixing.\n\nWe note that similar results were obtained under a 'cycling' strategy (S5 Text).\n\nData obtained from Rabin medical center, Israel, is used to estimate realistic single and double antibiotic resistance frequencies in incoming patients.\n\nMethods Ethics statement The study was approved by the Helsinki Committee of Rabin Medical Center.\n\nThe model We have developed a mathematical model consisting of eight differential equations, describing the changes in the frequencies of patients infected with different bacterial strains within a hospital unit.\n\nThe model is an extension of existing models, used for evaluating and predicting the efficiency of antibiotic treatment strategies [23,24,26,27].\n\nHere we assume there are three antibiotics available for empiric treatment, rather than two, as in most classical models.\n\nThis extension allows us to consider the contribution of both double and single resistant bacteria to the emergence of triple resistance.\n\nFrequencies of resistance can vary significantly between strategies and conditions, so incorporating different combinations of resistant types entails a more realistic depiction of the dynamics.\n\nWe denote by S the frequency of patients infected with bacteria susceptible to all three antibiotics; Ri is the frequency of patients infected with strains resistant only to antibiotic i, for i \u220a {1, 2, 3}; Ri,j is the frequency of patients infected with bacteria resistant to both antibiotics i and j, and only to these antibiotics, for (j, k) \u220a {(1, 2),(1, 3), (2, 3)}; X is the frequency of patients uninfected with any of the bacterial strains.\n\nWe assume that strains resistant to all three antibiotics are not present yet, and only the rate of their emergence is estimated.\n\nEach infected patient is immediately treated upon admission, with one antibiotic only, and is either cleared from infection or acquires resistance with rate \u03c4.\n\nThe probability of acquiring resistance to antibiotic i is pi, so that the rate of resistance acquisition upon treatment is \u03c4pi, and the rate of clearance is \u03c4(1\u2212pi).\n\nFor each strategy, \u03c7i is the fraction of patients initially receiving antibiotic i.\n\nThe mixing strategy consists of the application of drugs at constant probabilities throughout time.\n\nUsing only two drugs, while reserving the third drug to double resistant infections alone, will be termed mix2.\n\nFormally:.\n\nThe application of all three drugs equally will be denoted mix3:.\n\nA patient carrying an infection with a confirmed resistance to antibiotic k has to be treated with either antibiotic i or j.\n\nSuch a patient will be treated with antibiotic i with probability .\n\nE.g. if a patient is found (through microbiological testing) to be resistant only to antibiotic 1, under mix2 he will receive antibiotic 2 only , while under mix3 and he will receive either antibiotic 2 or 3 with equal probability .\n\nFor simplicity, we do not differentiate between patients acquiring resistance during treatment and those admitted with resistance.\n\nAn infection resistant to antibiotic i is assumed to be unaffected by treatment with it.\n\nPatients treated incorrectly\u2014i.e., with an antibiotic that their infection is resistant to\u2014are switched to a correct treatment after a delay period [27].\n\nThis is modeled by assigning a slower clearance rate to a proportion of the patients carrying resistant infections.\n\nThe rate of recovery when the delay applies is given by \u03c4d, so that for a delay of D days, we define .\n\nThus, for example, a fraction \u03c71 of patients of class R1 will have a recovery rate of \u03c4d while a fraction \u03c71 + \u03c73 of that class will have a recovery rate \u03c4.\n\nA fraction will be treated with antibiotic 2, after a delay, and their rate of resistance acquisition will be d\u03c4p2.\n\n\u03b3 is the rate of spontaneous recovery due to the response of the patient's immune system; \u03b2 is the rate of bacterial transmissions resulting in infection (for simplicity, super-infection is neglected).\n\nSince we assume the bacterial infection considered is not the main reason of hospitalization, patients leave the hospital, or die, at a rate proportional to their frequency, with the proportion constant c.\n\nThis common assumption allows us to model constant hospital occupancy.\n\n\u03bbV is the rate of patients of class V entering the hospital (e.g., \u03bbS is the rate of patients admitted to the hospital with bacteria susceptible to all three antibiotics).\n\nWe assume a constant population size, so that the total admission rate is equal to the discharge rate, namely:.\n\nFor convenience, we also define the auxiliary parameters .\n\nfV is the frequency of incoming patients carrying a resistant pathogen of class V out of all patients carrying the pathogen, and will be used throughout this work.\n\nThe model parameters, interpretations, values used and references (taken from [20,28\u201335]) are given at Table 1.\n\nDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG

equations (for i \u220a {1, 2, 3},(j, k) \u220a {(1, 2),(1, 3), (2, 3)}, i \u2260 j \u2260 k): (1) An illustration of the dynamics is given in Fig 1.\n\nDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image

the hospital and the community; circles representing patient frequencies within the hospital, and squares representing the frequencies of patients infected with bacterial strains in the community, with respect to variable names within the shapes (see methods).\n\nColored arrows show the direction of resistance acquisition due to treatment; solid black arrows are recovery from infected to cleared states, while dashed lines are infections.\n\nSeveral arrows are marked with the corresponding rates of flow between variables.\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004340.g001We derived an analytical approximation of the equilibrium state of (Eq 1) (see S1 Text for the analysis and agreement between the approximation and the numerical solution of the equilibrium).\n\nWe note that our model can be reduced to a two-drug model, if all the parameters and variables pertaining to double resistance and to resistance to the third drug are set to zero.\n\nWe can model a strategy where only the first drug is used, except for treatment of resistant infections, and two alternative strategies of mixing and cycling both drugs (see supplementary material III).\n\nAdding community feedback We also include in our model the impact of different strategies on resistance rates in the community.\n\nGiven that the mean patient length of stay is days, then on average a fraction c of the patients leave (and enter) each day.\n\nWe will denote the ratio of the hospital size to the size of the community it serves as \u03c0.\n\nThe number of hospital beds per capita can serve as an estimate for \u03c0, and the estimate is usually within the range , with for developed countries [35].\n\nWe assume that the total incidence of infection by the modeled pathogen is constant and model only the change in the distribution of different types of resistant infections within the community.\n\nThis is modeled by changing the frequencies of different incoming patients (which are proportional to the entrance rates) from constant in (Eq 1) to dynamic.\n\nWe add to (Eq 1) the following ODEs: For V \u220a {S, R1, R2, R3, R1,2, R1,3, R2,3}.\n\nThus the entrance rates of all infected patients () become dynamic and are affected by the efflux of the various strains to the community.\n\nThe chosen method of modeling assumes that the discharged patients are replacing patients in the community (which are admitted into the hospital) at rate c, with the weight of each discharged patient, relative to the community, being \u03c0.\n\nAlthough models explicitly computing the dynamics in the community exist [36], we chose a simplified model that captures the main component, of varying strength of influence of the hospital on the community (\u03c0).\n\nMeasuring the strategies' efficiency We employ two criteria to measure the efficiency of each treatment strategy: First, we measure the mean frequency of incorrectly treated patients.\n\nThis measure was chosen since inadequate treatment leads to higher mortality, in single-resistant and MDR bacteria [6,37,38].\n\nThe mean frequency of initially incorrectly treated patients under a strategy \u03c3 \u220a {mix2, mix3}, for i \u220a {1, 2, 3},(j, k) \u220a {(1, 2),(1, 3), (2, 3)}, i \u2260 j \u2260 k), is: Where t0, t1 are the times of beginning and end of measuring, respectively.\n\nSecond, we measure the emergence rate of triple resistant bacteria.\n\nWe estimate triple resistance emergence as proportional to the number of double resistant infections treated with the only antibiotic they are susceptible to.\n\nTherefore, the mean emergence rate of triple resistance under a treatment strategy \u03c3 is proportional (with the proportion constant being the clearance rate) to: We used several methods to decide which parameters are most influential in our system.\n\nFirst, we used the analytical approximation of the equilibrium state of the ODE system without the community feedback to see the influence of various parameters on the system (S1 Text).\n\nIn addition, we performed a parameter sensitivity analysis (PSA) of the system (S4 Text).\n\nThe result of the PSA suggested that the resistance frequencies of incoming patients are the most influential parameters on the dynamics.\n\nWe thus focus on these parameters and use estimates from clinical data for their values.\n\nWe also performed pairwise comparisons of parameters to determine the effect of their interaction on the emergence of triple resistance (S2 Text).\n\nTo further investigate the implications of our model, we estimated realistic resistance frequencies of incoming patients, using data gathered from patients in Rabin medical center, Israel, dating 2009\u20132012, that had positive blood cultures for bacteremia.\n\nWe used antibiotic resistance profiles of blood cultures obtained up to 48 hours after patient admission, to avoid estimating resistant infections acquired within the hospital.\n\nAntibiotics co-occurring in resistance tests were divided to all possible pairs, and frequencies of single and double resistance were estimated (corresponding to f1, f2 and f1,2).\n\nOnly observations with \u226550 instances of testing for resistance of both antibiotics were considered, resulting in 73 pairs of antibiotics (see S1 Table).\n\nResultsWe concentrate on a scenario in which two antibiotics (in our model, antibiotics 1 and 2) are frequently used, and resistance levels to them are not low.\n\nIn contrast, antibiotics 3 is assumed to have thus far been restricted for emergency use only, and the frequency of resistance to it is still low.\n\nWe examine the change prompted by enabling the broad usage of antibiotic 3 under the mixing strategy.\n\nThe mixing strategy can be thought of as the default strategy applied in hospitals, when physicians are prescribing antibiotics from a predetermined set, with no specific time-dependent preference.\n\nWe use our mathematical model to examine the effect of mixing the three antibiotics available versus mixing only two and restricting the third (mix3 and mix2, respectively).\n\nWe start by examining the frequency of double and single resistance of incoming patients' infections, with respect to the commonly used antibiotics ( and , respectively).\n\nWhereas resistances to different antibiotics might be independent (), selection for resistance could drive the double resistance frequencies to higher values than expected by random.\n\nIn Fig 2 we set the values of single resistance frequency to , while varying on the horizontal axis.\n\nDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Fig 2.\n\nThe mixing strategy for varying double resistance frequencies.We measure the fraction of incorrect treatment (A), and the rate of triple resistance emergence (B) for varying levels of double resistance to the commonly used antibiotics ().\n\nRed curves represent the results under mixing 2 antibiotics and restricting antibiotic 3 (mix2), while green curves are the results under mixing 3 antibiotics (mix3).\n\nDotted and solid lines are the results of the model with and without community feedback, respectively.\n\nParameters are , and the rest are given at Table 1.\n\nThe system is simulated for 20 years and other parameter values are given in the text.\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004340.g002The vertical axis presents the mean fraction of incorrectly treated patients (Fig 2A), and mean triple resistance emergence rate (Fig 2B) over 20 years.\n\nWe plot the results of the model assuming no effect of hospital resistance frequencies on the community (solid lines) and of the model with community feedback (dotted lines).\n\nWe set the double resistance frequencies for the third restricted antibiotic to , as a conservative estimation.\n\nSimilar results are obtained when resistance to antibiotic 3 is assumed to be independent of resistance to antibiotics 1 and 2.\n\nOther parameters are .\n\nReferences for the parameter values used are given in Table 1.\n\nWe can see that introducing the previously restricted drug to common usage decreases the prevalence of incorrect treatment in our model, whether regarding community feedback or not (Fig 2A).\n\nThis is intuitive, as a relatively small fraction of the incoming patients is resistant to antibiotic 3, and thus using it leads to a decreased probability of incorrect treatment.\n\nWhen considering the emergence of triple resistance, the picture is more complex.\n\nOn the one hand, the unrestricted usage of the antibiotic 3 limits the spread of double resistance, most common of which is resistance to antibiotics 1 and 2.\n\nOn the other hand, more frequent usage of antibiotic 3 causes more patients to acquire resistance to it during treatment.\n\nThis can be seen when examining the triple resistance emergence (Triple(\u03c3)).\n\nIf we assume that resistance to both common drugs is significantly higher than resistance to the third drug, then Triple(\u03c3) is dominated by the term: The homogeneity in time of the mixing strategies allows for a simple analysis.\n\nE(\u03c3) under mix2 becomes while for mix 3 it becomes Thus the condition for reducing triple resistance emergence under mix3 is approximately E(mix2) > E(mix3), which implies that triple resistance is lower under mix3 at a time point t if (2) Thus mix3 improves as switching to a correct treatment is done faster.\n\nHad patients been immediately treated with an effective drug (d = 1), the strategy best minimizing R1,2 would have reduced triple resistance emergence.\n\nWhen a delay occurs, mix3 will have to reduce R1,2 by a factor of , relative to mix2.\n\nThis is a lower bound (i.e. mix3 will have to reduce double resistance more than the mentioned factor) since the neglected terms (R1,3, R2,3) are higher under mix3 than under mix2.\n\nFurthermore, under mix3 R1,3, R2,3 might increase with time due to selective pressure, leading to a substantial underestimation of the bound in (Eq 2).\n\nWe should note that if one strategy is able to decrease both incorrect treatment and triple resistance emergence more efficiently than another, then this strategy should be preferred.\n\nHowever, when one strategy is only better at reducing incorrect treatment, while producing higher triple resistance, the costs and benefits of the two effects should be considered.\n\nFurthermore, we examined the effects of various parameters on the emergence of triple resistance under mix3 relative to mix2 (S4 Text).\n\nWe note that triple resistance emergence can be decomposed to two main components: the resistance emanating from the common double resistant strain (R1,2), mainly affected by infection; and from the rare double resistant infections (R1,3 + R2,3), which are usually a result of resistance acquisition.\n\nTypically, mix3 decreases R1,2 and increases R1,3 + R2,3, in comparison to mix2.\n\nThe parameters can act in opposing ways on these two terms.\n\nHigh transmission rates (\u03b2) increase the effectiveness of mix3, since the main advantage of using the restricted drug is inhibiting the spread of R1,2 (Fig A in S4 Text).\n\nThe opposite is true for the patient turnover rate (c): high turnover limits the potential time for transmission, and requires higher transmission rates for R1,2 to be substantial and for mix3 to be effective (Fig C in S4 Text).\n\nHigh antibiotic clearance rates (\u03c4) increase the advantage of mix3, under which R1,2 patients have a higher probability of being correctly treated (Fig A and B in S4 Text.\n\nSimilar results are obtained when the rate of clearance \u03c4 varies while the rate of acquisition \u03c4pi is kept constant: Fig E in S4 Text).\n\nThese parameters act similarly on R1,3 + R2,3, but the relative weight of R1,2 is usually higher than that of R1,3 + R2,3.\n\nThus high transmission rates, low turnover rates, and high clearance rates are conditions where restriction might be inefficient for reducing triple resistance emergence.\n\nHowever, antibiotic clearance rates also have a strong interaction with the delay of correct treatment (1/d).\n\nWhen the delay of treatment is short but realistic\u2014about two days ()\u2014mix3 is more efficient than mix2 even for low clearance rates (Fig B in S4 Text).\n\nThis corresponds to the result obtained above in (Eq 2).\n\nThe probabilities of resistance acquisition (p1, p2, p3) also play a role in the dynamics' outcome.\n\nAs expected, mix3 will be less effective if resistance to antibiotic 3 is easily acquired\u2014high p3 relative to p1, p2 (Fig D in S4 Text).\n\nAnother important factor that can affect the hospital dynamics is the feedback from the community.\n\nIn Fig 3 we again decompose the frequency of resistant strains to R1,2 and R1,3 + R2,3, and compare the levels of incorrect treatment and triple resistance emergence for mix2 (Fig 3A) and mix3 (Fig 3B).\n\nDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Fig 3.\n\nTime series of mix2 (A) and mix3 (B).We plot the frequencies of double resistant infections resistant to the third antibiotic (R1,3 + R2,3), the double resistant infections resistant to the two commonly used antibiotics (R1,2), the measured incorrectly treated patients, and the emergence of triple resistance.\n\nThe model is simulated for an extended period of time (100 years) to capture long term effects and the rest of the parameters are as in Fig 2.\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004340.g003The parameters used are as in Fig 2, with f1,2 = 0.5 f1.\n\nOne might presume that mix3 will be inefficient in the long term, as it results in increased R1,3 + R2,3 over time.\n\nIn contrast, the dynamics show that the rapid increase of R1,2 under mix2 might be a more serious pitfall under these parameters, and the sum of all double resistant infections is lower under mix3 than under mix2.\n\nAs a result mix3 stays more efficient than mix2 for extended periods of time.\n\nDecreasing the number of hospital beds per capita relative to the community (\u03c0) reduces this effect, with \u03c0 = 0 equivalent to the model without community.\n\nTo further investigate the implications of our model, we estimated single and double resistance frequencies of the common drugs (f1, f2 and f1,2) from patients in Rabin medical center, Israel, dating 2009\u20132012 (see Methods).\n\nWe simulated our model using the estimated resistance frequencies among incoming patients, with the rest of the parameters as in Fig 2.\n\nFig 4 presents the ratios of incorrectly treated patients and triple resistance emergence, in mix3 relative to mix2, for both the model without community feedback (Fig 4A) and with community feedback (Fig 4B).\n\nDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF

relative to mix2 according to our model, and its location on the Y axis represents the predicted ratio of triple resistance emergence.\n\nA red line is drawn where the strategies inhibit triple resistance equally well, so below the line mix3 reduces both incorrect treatment and triple resistance emergence more efficiently than mix2.\n\nPanels A and B present the results of the models without community feedback and with it, respectively.\n\nAntibiotic resistance frequencies among incoming patients are estimated from data (see Methods and S1 Table).\n\nThe color indicates the estimated resistance frequencies to the common antibiotics ().\n\nThe system is simulated for 20 years and the rest of the parameters are as in Fig 2.\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004340.g004The colors represent the sum of the estimated resistances in each sample ().\n\nWe can see that mix3 reduces incorrect treatment by ~40% relative to mix2 (Fig 4, horizontal axis), and has contrasting effects on triple resistance emergence: Albeit mix3 increases triple resistance emergence rate by about 1% for some samples, it usually reduces it by up to 10%, relative to mix2 (Fig 4, vertical axis).\n\nWe see that under low levels of resistance among the infections of incoming patients, mix3 is strictly preferred over mix2\u2014it reduces both triple resistance emergence and incorrect treatment.\n\nWhen higher levels of resistance are present, the dynamics may change so that refraining from treating with antibiotic 3, except when the other two antibiotics fail, decreases triple emergence.\n\nThis is once again the trade-off between effective short term treatment and the risk of creating new MDR bacteria.\n\nWe can also see that both ratios of incorrect treatment and triple resistance emergence rates tend to be smaller, indicating a stronger preference for mix3, when the hospital population has an effect on the community (Fig 4, compare panel A to panel B).\n\nThis occurs due to the quick rise of R1,2 under mix2, and its influence on the community resistance, which is moderated under the more diverse treatment of mix3.\n\nDiscussionIn this work we examined whether restricting the usage of certain antibiotic agents, i.e. keeping them as 'last resorts', is effective in inhibiting the spread of MDR bacteria.\n\nWe developed a model describing hospital dynamics of a bacterial pathogen potentially treated by three available antibiotics.\n\nWe assumed that the pathogen is treated by two commonly used drugs, and a third drug is only used when an infection is resistant to both common drugs.\n\nWe examined the scenario where the common drugs have been used for a long enough period, so that resistance to each of the drugs, and double resistance to both of them, is not very uncommon.\n\nWe tested the efficiency of restricting versus using the third drug extensively, for a common antibiotic usage strategy: mixing.\n\nThe criteria for efficiency were defined as the mean number of incorrectly treated patients, and the rate of triple resistance emergence.\n\nWe considered dynamic resistance frequencies in the community, affected by patients discharged from the hospital, as well as constant frequencies.\n\nWe conclude that introducing the previously restricted antibiotic to broad usage always decreases incorrect treatment, and can even simultaneously reduce the emergence of triple resistance sometimes.\n\nA similar question can be asked considering only two antibiotics; one commonly used and one restricted.\n\nIn such a simple model, the usage of two antibiotics will decrease the level of incorrect treatment, and under some conditions also the resistance emergence (see S3 Text).\n\nHowever, the simple model does not apply when double resistant strains are already present, as is the case for many antibiotics (see S1 Table).\n\nOne major difference between the models is the rate of conversion from the sensitive type to the multiply resistant type.\n\nMore steps of resistance acquisition are required for multiple resistance in the 3-antibiotics model, and treatment strategies using all drugs or restricting some of them may affect the intermediate resistant types differently.\n\nHowever, an important insight to be gained from the simple model is that infections can be crudely separated to resistant and sensitive to the restricted drug.\n\nThis decomposition was found useful in analyzing the influence of the model parameters on the emergence of triple resistance.\n\nWe found that when bacterial transmission is high, restricting antibiotics is usually not the preferred strategy.\n\nLong hospitalization times have a similar effect, and if bacterial transmission is indeed substantial, restricting antibiotics may not be advisable if the patients' mean length of stay is above several days.\n\nAdditionally, if antibiotic clearance times are intermediate (less than weeks), or even low but the switch to correct treatment is rapid (less than two days), restricting antibiotics also performs poorly.\n\nWe extended our model and considered the interaction between the hospital and the community: where resistance frequencies in the community are affected by the efflux of resistant infections discharged from the hospital, and resistance frequencies among incoming patients are affected by resistance in the community.\n\nThe weight of the community in the emergence of MDR is hard to determine.\n\nThe cost of resistance, for instance, could cause a reversion of resistance in bacterial populations that were not recently exposed to a certain antibiotic.\n\nAs a consequence, the community resistance frequencies would be less influenced by the patient efflux, which is equivalent to low effect of the hospital on the community in our model.\n\nHowever, the significance of the cost of resistance is debatable and perhaps reversion to susceptibility is not often feasible in relevant time scales [39,40].\n\nTherefore, we examined the dynamics with both a relatively high and a negligible influence of the hospital on the community.\n\nThe community feedback tended to decrease the efficiency of restricting antibiotics.\n\nThe high usage of only two drugs gave rise to a steady increase in double resistant strains, in the hospital as well as in the community, inevitably treated with the restricted drug and increasing the emergence of triple resistance.\n\nFinally, we simulated our model using incoming single and double resistance frequencies estimated from data.\n\nAgain, restricting antibiotics was usually the less efficient strategy, both with and without the community feedback.\n\nInterestingly, it was recently shown that hospital size affects resistance frequencies [41].\n\nSmall hospitals may facilitate extinction of rare resistant strains, and can have substantial effect on the rare infections resistant to the third drug.\n\nHowever, this phenomenon may be mitigated by the resistant strains in the community, and entails further attention.\n\nWe focus on mixing a prominent antibiotic prescription strategy, but other treatment strategies may also be considered.\n\nSimilar results were obtained when running our analyses on the cycling strategy, where drugs are periodically switched every 100 days (S5 Text).\n\nAnother example is combination therapy, in which patients are treated with several drugs simultaneously.\n\nOur model is applicable for this strategy if each of the drugs in the restricted combination have not been abundantly used in the formerly prescribed combinations.\n\nTo some extent, single drugs in our model (i.e. antibiotics 1, 2, and 3) can be used to describe combinations of drugs, with the addition of a term for partial resistance, due to the overlap of drugs between different combinations.\n\nHowever, the efficiency and toxicity of combination therapy are still a subject of controversy [42].\n\nMoreover, we have previously shown that combination therapy might increase MDR significantly if genetic variation rates are stress-induced [26], suggesting that its use should be carefully considered in such cases.\n\nOne could claim that last resort drugs should be reserved for severe infections, to minimize resistance in high risk patients.\n\nIn contrast, we show that although the usage of the restricted drug can increase its marginal resistance levels, the probability of getting infected by bacteria resistant to all drugs is also decreased.\n\nThus, severe infections with limited treatment options are also minimized.\n\nOur results suggest that the current frequency of resistance to alternative drugs is an important component to be considered when deciding upon the restriction or usage of an antibiotic.\n\nSince resistance frequencies can substantially vary between communities [43,44], a sound local estimate of them might be need.\n\nThis could be obtained by analyzing the records of resistance screens performed on incoming patients, often already available at no additional cost, and perhaps also by sampling commensal bacteria, whose resistance pattern are correlated with the resistance pattern of the infecting bacteria [45].\n\nAnalysis of local resistance frequencies could contribute to properly deciding whether to restrict or broadly use certain antibiotics, as well as to monitor and estimate the efficiency of this decision.\n\nMoreover, such data has also been proposed for 'informed' strategies: dynamically changing the proportions of drugs prescribed as a function of recent resistance instances within the hospital [46].\n\nIncorporating restricted drug usage with these strategies might lead to even better results at minimizing resistance emergence.\n\nIn conclusion, we show that restricted usage of certain drugs, when resistance to the alternative drugs is already present, may sometimes hinder the fight against MDR bacteria.\n\nWe would like to emphasize that we do not encourage superfluous or increased usage of antibiotics, but rather suggest that changing the proportions of currently used drugs may assist the fight against antibiotic resistance.\n\nWe hope that our work will promote clinical studies and empirical assessment of the benefits and pitfalls of such a change in treatment policies.\n\nSupporting InformationS1 Text.\n\nApproximating equilibrium.doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004340.s001(DOCX) S2 Text.\n\nParametric sensitivity

{"content": "Abstract Background The spread of multi-resistant infections represents a continuously growing problem in cirrhosis, particularly in patients in contact with the healthcare environment.\n\nAim Our prospective study aimed to analyze epidemiology, prevalence and risk factors of multi-resistant infections, as well as the rate of failure of empirical antibiotic therapy in cirrhotic patients.\n\nMethods All consecutive cirrhotic patients hospitalized between 2008 and 2013 with a microbiologically-documented infection (MDI) were enrolled.\n\nInfections were classified as Community-Acquired (CA), Hospital-Acquired (HA) and Healthcare-Associated (HCA).\n\nBacteria were classified as Multidrug-Resistant (MDR) if resistant to at least three antimicrobial classes, Extensively-Drug-Resistant (XDR) if only sensitive to one/two classes and Pandrug-Resistant (PDR) if resistant to all classes.\n\nResults One-hundred-twenty-four infections (15% CA, 52% HA, 33% HCA) were observed in 111 patients.\n\nUrinary tract infections, pneumonia and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis were the more frequent.\n\nForty-seven percent of infections were caused by Gram-negative bacteria.\n\nFifty-one percent of the isolates were multi-resistant to antibiotic therapy (76% MDR, 21% XDR, 3% PDR): the use of antibiotic prophylaxis (OR = 8.4; 95%CI = 1.03-76; P = 0,05) and current/recent contact with the healthcare-system (OR = 3.7; 95%CI = 1.05-13; P = 0.04) were selected as independent predictors.\n\nThe failure of the empirical antibiotic therapy was progressively more frequent according to the degree of resistance.\n\nThe therapy was inappropriate in the majority of HA and HCA infections.\n\nConclusions Multi-resistant infections are increasing in hospitalized cirrhotic patients.\n\nA better knowledge of the epidemiological characteristics is important to improve the efficacy of empirical antibiotic therapy.\n\nThe use of preventive measures aimed at reducing the spread of multi-resistant bacteria is also essential.\n\nCitation: Merli M, Lucidi C, Di Gregorio V, Falcone M, Giannelli V, Lattanzi B, et al.\n\n(2015) The Spread of Multi Drug

the characteristics of the problem may vary geographically, temporally and according to the healthcare setting [1, 2].\n\nInfections caused by resistant pathogens are usually encountered in the hospital setting, besides, the diffusion of health-care assistance beyond the hospital is currently leading to a spread of antibiotic resistant pathogens in the general healthcare system.\n\nThis problem is associated with worse patients\u2019 clinical outcomes during infections.\n\nCirrhotic patients, in their advanced stage, are highly susceptible to infections, are frequently in need of assistance from the health-care system and of antibiotic therapies (either for treatment or for prophylaxis) and are subject to recurrent hospitalizations for complications of the disease.\n\nSeveral authors have recently warned for an increasing incidence of infections caused by multi-resistant bacteria in cirrhosis [3\u20135].\n\nA well-accepted definition of multi- resistant organisms is based on the resistance in vitro to at least one agent in three or more antimicrobial categories [6, 7].\n\nAlthough the names of certain multi-resistant organism describe resistance to only one agent (e.g., methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci), these pathogens are frequently resistant to most available antimicrobial agents.\n\nFor epidemiological purposes, due to the large variety of the pathogens included in this group, a further sub-classification has been proposed in recent years: pathogens non-susceptible to at least one agent in all but two or fewer antimicrobial categories (i.e. bacterial isolates remain susceptible to only one or two categories) are classifiable as Extensively-drug Resistant (XDR) and those nonsusceptible to all agents in all antimicrobial categories as Pan-drug Resistant (PDR) [8].\n\nIn the last years, epidemiology, risk factors and clinical outcomes of multi-resistant infections, particularly according to their epidemiological origin, have raised special attention in cirrhosis.\n\nThe above proposed classification could be highly relevant for epidemiological purposes as it introduces a harmonized terminology, takes into consideration the severity of bacterial resistance and therapeutic consequences.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, we applied the classification in MDR, XDR and PDR in cirrhotic patients for the first time, describing a high rate of MDR and XDR infections [9].\n\nA recent retrospective study limited to bloodstream infections, also reported a high rate of Gram negative MDR and XDR pathogens among cirrhotic patients [10].\n\nOur study was carried out prospectively in order to assess characteristics, risk factors and outcome of multi- resistant infections in a large series of hospitalized cirrhotic patients.\n\nFor this aim we considered only patients with microbiologically documented infections (MDI).\n\nEpisodes of infection were classified according to the different degree of multi-resistance (MDR, XDR, PDR).\n\nThe efficacy of currently recommended empirical antibiotic therapy was also evaluated.\n\nPatients and Methods Patients All cirrhotic patients consecutively admitted to our Department University hospital from October 2008 to June 2013, were considered for enrollment.\n\nOnly patients admitted with MDI or developing it during hospitalization were included in the study.\n\nConcomitant immunosuppressant conditions (HIV infection, high dose corticosteroid treatment and other immunosuppressive therapies) and hepatocellular carcinoma out of the Milan criteria were considered as exclusion criteria.\n\nAt admission, relevant baseline demographic, clinical and biochemical data were recorded.\n\nThe data collection was performed taking carefully into account the possible risk factors for infections caused by multi-resistant bacteria (site of acquisition of the infection, recent use of antibiotics, previous hospitalization, previous infections, invasive procedures, long-term quinolone-prophylaxis).\n\nThe severity of liver disease was assessed using the Child\u2013Pugh and the model of end-stage liver disease (MELD) scores.\n\nThe study was approved by the local Ethical Committee Review Board (Policlinico Umberto I) and a written informed consent was obtained by all the participants to allow the collection of their individual data pertaining their previous history and hospitalization.\n\nAssessment of infections and antibiotic treatments Episodes of infections were always actively sought out either at admission or during the hospital stay.\n\nA detailed form concerning the infectious episodes, was compiled including the epidemiological characteristics, the site of infection, the result of positive microbiology cultures, the results of white blood cells count and inflammatory indices, the antibiotic therapy.\n\nInformation regarding the clinical events during hospitalization were also collected (i.e., efficacy of the initial empirical antibiotic therapy, complications related to infection, resolution, and hospital mortality).\n\nThe diagnosis of bacterial infection was based on previously reported standard criteria [3].\n\nAccording to their epidemiological characteristics, infections were classified as follows: (1) Hospital acquired (HA) in case of infection onset at least 48 hours after the admission, or within 10 days of leaving the hospital, or if the patient was coming from another department.\n\n(2) Health-care associated (HCA) if the diagnosis was made at hospital admission or within 48 hours of hospitalization in patients with any of the following criteria: a) had attended a hospital or a hemodialysis clinic or received intravenous chemotherapy in the last 30 days, b) was hospitalized for at least two days or had undergone surgery during the 90 days before infection or c) had resided in a nursing home or a long-term care facility.\n\n(3) Community acquired (CA) if the diagnosis of infection was made within 48 hours of hospitalization and the patient did not fulfil the criteria for HCA infection (had no recent contact with the health-care system) [11, 12].\n\nProphylaxis and treatment of infections Patients with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding or previous spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) or subjected to invasive procedures for which prophylaxis was indicated, were treated with antibiotic therapy according to the general guidelines or our hospital protocol for invasive procedures.\n\nWhen an infection was suspected, after a prompt collection of the culture specimens, patients were immediately treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics according to the likely site of infection, in accordance with current guidelines [13] and considering the local epidemiology.\n\nAntimicrobial treatment before the result of cultures and the tests of the in vitro susceptibility was considered empirical, and became definite only when this information was available.\n\nEmpirical antibiotic treatment was considered appropriate only when the isolated bacteria was found to have in vitro susceptibility to that antibiotic.\n\nIf not the antibiotic therapy was accordingly changed.\n\nClassification of multi-resistance We considered \u201cmulti-resistant\u201d all pathogens resistant to three or more antimicrobial classes.\n\nAmong them, according to the international classification of the different degrees of multi-resistance, infections were divided as follows [8]: (a) \"Multidrug-resistant\" (expressed as MDR) if the pathogen was resistant to three or more antimicrobial classes, but susceptible to at least three classes.\n\n(b) \"Extensively Drug-Resistant\" (XDR) when the pathogen was sensitive only to one or two classes.\n\n(c) \"Pandrug-Resistant\" (PDR) when the pathogen was resistant to all antimicrobial classes.\n\nFor these definitions, bacterial isolates were considered resistant to an antimicrobial class when they were not susceptible to at least one member of the class.\n\nStatistical analysis All the values are reported as means \u00b1 SD and p values <0,05 were considered statistically significant.\n\nDifferences among CA/HA/HCA groups were compared using the chi-squared test or ANOVA.\n\nRejection of the null hypothesis implies that at least one of the three groups was different from the other two.\n\nWhen the hypothesis was significant, we performed post-hoc multiplicity adjusted multiple comparison.\n\nDifferences between MDR and XDR groups were evaluated by means of the Student\u2019s test for unpaired data or the chi-squared test, as appropriate.\n\nThe paired sample t-test was used to longitudinally compare psychometric performances.\n\nThe correlation between psychometric tests and inflammatory indices was analyzed by Pearson\u2019s correlation Logistic regression analysis was employed to identify possible predictors of the cognitive impairment.\n\nWe do not further adjust for multiple comparison with respect to the outcomes considered and report raw p-values, as any adjustment would lead to the same conclusions regarding statistical significance.\n\nThe software used for the analysis was NCSS (Number Cruncher Statystical System) 2007.\n\nResults Patients During the enrollment period, 424 cirrhotic patients, were hospitalized in our ward.\n\nTwenty-five patients were excluded: 5 because of the concomitant use of immunosuppressive medications and 20 because of a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma out of the Milan criteria.\n\nA bacterial infection was documented at admission or during hospitalization in 173 (39%) patients.\n\nSixty-two patients had a culture-negative infection, 111 had a diagnosis of MDI.\n\nDemographic characteristics and severity of liver disease were similar in patients with MDI and in those with culture negative infections (data not shown).\n\nThe median age of the 111 patients was 60 \u00b1 13 years, 64% were males.\n\nOrigin of liver disease was hepatitis C in 42%, hepatitis B in 10%, alcohol abuse in 23% (12% of the patients were active alcohol abusers at the time of admission).\n\nThe majority of patients had a decompensated liver disease (53% Child-Pugh B, 36% Child-Pugh C) and the mean MELD score was 16.5 \u00b1 7.\n\nThe main reasons for admission were the onset of portal-hypertension related complications (ascites 23.6%, hepatic encephalopathy 26.4%, acute gastrointestinal bleeding 4.5%), elective invasive procedures (10.9%), fever (7.3%) or indirect signs of infection (6.4%).\n\nAt admission, 68 patients had evidence of ascites, 73 patients had esophageal varices (in 29% large varices at risk of bleeding).\n\nFifty-nine patients had hepatic encephalopathy either at admission or during hospitalization.\n\nTwenty-one patients had a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma within the Milan criteria.\n\nForty-one patients (37%) had a diagnosis of diabetes.\n\nPatients characteristic according to the epidemiology of the infections.The demographic, clinical and biochemical data of the patients enrolled in the study according to epidemiological classifications of the infections are summarized in Table 1.\n\nDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Table 1.\n\nDemographic, clinical and biochemical characteristics of the 111 patients enrolled in the study according to the epidemiological class of the first infection: Community Acquired (CA), Hospital Acquired (HA) and Healthcare

hepatocellular carcinoma and active alcohol abuse.\n\nSeverity of liver disease, as evidenced by the MELD and Child-Pugh score were also similar.\n\nHA infections were more frequently associated with sepsis.\n\nIn-hospital mortality, although higher in patients with HA and HCA infections, was not significantly different from CA.\n\nMicrobiologically documented infections in the different epidemiological classes Apart from the 111 diagnosis of MDI during admission, among the enrolled populations, 13 patients experienced a second MDI during the same hospitalization.\n\nTherefore, we considered 124 episodes of infection in 111 patients.\n\nCharacteristics of the 124 MDI according to the epidemiological classes are reported in Table 2.\n\nDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger

associated (HCA) infections).\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0127448.t002Urinary tract infections (UTIs), followed by pneumonia and SBP, were the most frequent infections in all the epidemiological classes.\n\nGram negative bacteria tended to be more frequent in CA and HCA infections while Gram-positive ones in HA.\n\nIn the latter group, the isolation of Gram-positive bacteria was associated with a higher number of invasive procedures during hospitalization (2.6 \u00b1 1.7 vs 1.9 \u00b1 1.9, p = 0.05).\n\nEnterobacteriaceae (44.3%) (particularly Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis), Enterococcae (Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis) (19.7%), Staphilococcus aureus (12.3%) and coagulase-negative Staphylococci (5.7%) were the pathogens most frequently responsible for infection.\n\nMulti-resistant infections.Multi-resistant bacteria were identified in half of healthcare-related infections (HCA and HA; Table 2).\n\nSpontaneous bacteremia, SBP and pneumonia were the infections with the higher probability of multiresistant bacteria (87%, 60% and 57%, respectively).\n\nAt variance, UTIs were more frequently caused by organisms sensitive to multiple antibiotic classes (57%).\n\nConcerning the susceptibility of the isolated pathogens, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis were multi-resistant in almost all the cases (82% and 100%, respectively), Enterococcae and Staphylococcus aureus in about half of the cases (59% and 53%, respectively).\n\nEscherichia coli and coagulase-negative Staphylococci were multi-resistant in 38% and 29%, respectively.\n\nAs shown in Table 3, the current or previous contact with the healthcare environment (HA or HCA infections) (p = 0.02), the use of antibiotics in the last month (p = 0.04) and the chronic antibiotic prophylaxis (p = 0.01) were factors associated with multi-resistant infections at univariate analysis.\n\nHealthcare associated origin of the infection (HA and HCA) (OR 3.7; 95% CI 1.05\u201313; P = 0.04) and the use of antibiotic prophylaxis (OR 8.4; 95% CI 1.03\u201376; P = 0.05) were selected as independent predictors for the development of bacterial multi-resistant infections at multivariate analysis.\n\nDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Table 3.\n\nPossible risk factors and outcomes of

multi-degree of resistance, we observed 47 MDR, 15 XDR and 2 PDR.\n\nBy a time-dependent analysis, we observed, over time, a trend toward an increase in the isolation of XDR/PDR pathogens.\n\nIn particular, the number of XDR/PDR isolated bacteria were almost doubled in the last two years (16% in 2008\u20132009 and 20% in 2010\u20132011 and 36% in 2012\u20132013).\n\nAmong the episodes due to multi-resistant pathogens, 57% of spontaneous bacteremia, 27% of SBP, 25% of pneumonia and 15% of UTIs were re-classified as XDR.\n\nConcerning the susceptibility of the main specific isolated pathogens, among the multi-resistant ones, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcae were re-classified as XDR respectively in 37.5%, 27% and 11%.\n\nNo specific risk factors for the severity of the degree of multi-resistance could be found in our cohort (Table 4).\n\nDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Table 4.\n\nPossible risk factors and outcomes of Multi-Drug Resistant (MDR) and Extensively- Drug Resistant (XDR) infections (Pan-drug Resistant infections were not considered due to the small sample size).\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0127448.t004 Empirical antibiotic failure and outcomes in multi-resistant infections.As expected, a higher rate of failure of empirical antibiotic therapy was observed in patients with MDR (60%) and in XDR infections (90%) compared to patients with an infection due to a non multi-resistant pathogen (37%) (Tables 3 and 4).\n\nA deterioration of liver function was documented in patients with multi-resistant infections.\n\nThere was a trend to a higher occurrence of deterioration of renal function, to a longer hospital stay (time between diagnosis of infection and discharge) and to a higher mortality rate, although without reaching statistical significance, during hospitalization in the multi-resistant group compared to non multi-resistant and in XDR group vs MDR (Tables 3 and 4).\n\nSpecifically, we observed a significantly higher rate of deterioration of renal function (23% vs 7%; p = 0.02), a longer hospital stay (20.6 \u00b1 14 vs 13.6 \u00b1 11; p = 0.003) and a higher in-hospital mortality (35% vs 10%, p = 0.001) in case of failure of the empirical antibiotic treatment.\n\nDiscussionWhile a significant improvement in the clinical management of cirrhotic patients has been seen in recent years, bacterial infections are still very frequent and cause severe complication in this group of patients [3].\n\nIn cirrhotic patients, the infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens represent a growing problem, even more than in the general population.\n\nIn the last decade, several studies have addressed the epidemiological characteristics of infections and the prevalence of antibiotic resistances in patients with cirrhosis [3\u20135, 10, 14].\n\nHowever, the microbiological characteristics may largely vary according to time and place, so the best way to drive the empirical antibiotic therapy is to known the actual local epidemiology.\n\nOur single centre prospective study, was aimed to assess epidemiological characteristics, risk factors and outcomes of multi-resistant infections in hospitalized cirrhotic patients.\n\nFor these aims, we considered all infectious sites and not only bloodstream infections or SBP, as in previous studies [4, 10]: UTIs and pneumonia were the prevalent infections in our cohort.\n\nUTIs are the most frequent type of infection in the majority of the clinical records, representing one of the main reason for administering empirical antibiotic therapy.\n\nTherefore, we think that the inclusion of this kind of infection enhances the clinical strength of our study.\n\nConcerning the microbiological characteristics of our cohort, Enterobacteriaceae, followed by Enterococcae, were the pathogens most often responsible for infections.\n\nAt the same time, as previously described, a growing prevalence of non-enterococcal Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative Staphylococci) was observed, particularly in the setting of HA infections and especially in patients undergone to multiple invasive procedures [5, 15].\n\nA multi-resistant pathogen was isolated in about half of patients.\n\nThis percentage is much higher than that reported by the majority of studies conducted in other countries [4, 5, 15, 16], due to the higher prevalence of multi-drug resistance in our hospital and to the epidemiological characteristics of the enrolled patients (high rate of HCA and HA infections).\n\nAs we previously reported, the majority of multi-resistant infections occurred, in fact, in patients hospitalized or with a recent contact with the hospital environment (53% in HA, 62% in HCA vs 22% in CA).\n\nA current or previous contact with the healthcare environment and the use of an antibiotic prophylaxis were both selected among the independent risk factors for multi-resistant bacterial infections suggesting a relevant role for the antibiotic pressure present in both this conditions.\n\nApplying the international classification proposed in general population [8] to further stratify the multiresistant infections, we documented that a relevant amount of multi-resistant infections were XDR (when the pathogen was sensitive only to one or two classes) and that this percentage was doubling in the last years as shown by a time-dependent analysis.\n\nNo specific risk factors for the severity of the degree of multi-resistance could be found in our cohort, probably due to the small size of this group.\n\nAs shown in our study, the increase in the prevalence of MDR and XDR infections among cirrhotic patients is associated to a more frequent failure of empirical antibiotic therapy.\n\nA deterioration of liver function was documented in patients with multi-resistant infections.\n\nA higher morbidity and mortality was observed progressively in patients with MDR and XDR, particularly in case of failure of the empirical antibiotic treatment.\n\nIn summary, although the results of the current study, deriving from a single centre experience with a specific microbiological pattern, cannot be generalized, our study may provide several practical messages.\n\nFirst, the high incidence of infections related to the healthcare system (HA and HCA) and their close relationship with multi-resistance underline the need to improve preventive measures against bacterial infections in hospital setting.\n\nA relocation of care from hospital to the home assistance and a better use of isolation precautions during hospitalization may be essential to limit the spread of multi-resistant organisms.\n\nHygienic measures, the use of catheters (both urinary and vascular) only when strictly necessary and the removal of these devices as soon as possible, may be the first steps.\n\nFurthermore, the indications for antibiotic prophylaxis should be carefully evaluated accordingly to the actual context.\n\nSecond, the knowledge of the own epidemiology is extremely important considering the high clinical relevance of a correct empirical antibiotic therapy.\n\nIn this scenario, a better stratification of the multi resistances may allow to better characterized this growing problem.\n\nMoreover, the high rate of first line antibiotic treatment failure in HCA, would imply the need for second-line therapies as well as in HA, although randomized trial are needed.\n\nThird, as emphasized in the general population [17], the risk of a rapid increase in pathogens potentially resistant to every drug on the market is increasing due to a \u201cdelay\u201d in the development of new antimicrobial classes.\n\nAnyway, in our study, although the number of XDR pathogens was relevant, the rate of PDR was still low leaving a little space to apply preventive measures.\n\nAn additional factor of improvement, finally, can be derived from the acquisition of the technology (now already available in several centers) needed to speed up bacterial isolation to quickly use of targeted antibiotic therapy.\n\nAuthor ContributionsConceived and designed the experiments: MM CL VDG MF MV OR.\n\nPerformed the experiments: CL VDG BL MG VG GC.\n\nAnalyzed the data:

{"content": "Identification of Acinetobacter baumannii Serum-Associated Antibiotic Efflux Pump Inhibitors Catlyn Blanchard, Pamela Barnett, Jessamyn Perlmutter and Paul M.\n\nDunman Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, New York, USA Next Section ABSTRACT Adaptive antibiotic resistance is a newly described phenomenon by which Acinetobacter baumannii induces efflux pump activity in response to host-associated environmental cues that may, in part, account for antibiotic treatment failures against clinically defined susceptible strains.\n\nTo that end, during adaptation to growth in human serum, the organism induces approximately 22 putative efflux-associated genes and displays efflux-mediated minocycline tolerance at antibiotic concentrations corresponding to patient serum levels.\n\nHere, we show that in addition to minocycline, growth in human serum elicits A.\n\nbaumannii efflux-mediated tolerance to the antibiotics ciprofloxacin, meropenem, tetracycline, and tigecycline.\n\nMoreover, using a whole-cell high-throughput screen and secondary assays, we identified novel serum-associated antibiotic efflux inhibitors that potentiated the activities of antibiotics toward serum-grown A.\n\nbaumannii.\n\nTwo compounds, Acinetobacter baumannii efflux pump inhibitor 1 (ABEPI1) [(E)-4-((4-chlorobenzylidene)amino)benezenesulfonamide] and ABEPI2 [N-tert-butyl-2-(1-tert-butyltetrazol-5-yl)sulfanylacetamide], were shown to lead to minocycline accumulation within A.\n\nbaumannii during serum growth and inhibit the efflux potential of the organism.\n\nWhile both compounds also inhibited the antibiotic efflux properties of the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, they did not display significant cytotoxicity toward human cells or mammalian Ca2+ channel inhibitory effects, suggesting that ABEPI1 and ABEPI2 represent promising structural scaffolds for the development of new classes of bacterial antibiotic efflux pump inhibitors that can be used to potentiate the activities of current and future antibiotics for the therapeutic intervention of Gram-negative bacterial infections.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section INTRODUCTION Acinetobacter baumannii has emerged as a major nosocomial pathogen that can cause ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and bacteremia, with associated mortality rates as high as 60% among susceptible patient populations (1\u20136).\n\nThe high rates of A.\n\nbaumannii-associated morbidity and mortality have largely been attributed to the emergence of antibiotic resistance that has compromised the effectiveness of the currently available antibiotics.\n\nIndeed, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently reported that 63% of all U.S. A.\n\nbaumannii infections are caused by multidrug-resistant strains that are resistant to three or more classes of antibiotics, and strains that are resistant to all classes of antibiotics have recently been identified in the United States and elsewhere (7\u201310).\n\nA.\n\nbaumannii antibiotic resistance is thought to be mediated by an expansive repertoire of enzymatic determinants, such as \u03b2-lactamases, as well as efflux pumps that extrude toxic agents, including antibiotics, from the cell (3, 11, 12).\n\nWith regard to the efflux pumps, the organism has been shown to harbor representatives of each of the five so-called bacterial drug efflux pump families: CraA and AmvA are major facilitator superfamily (MFS) pumps that are proposed to efflux chloramphenicol and erythromycin, respectively (13, 14), AbeM is a multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) family protein that effluxes aminoglycosides, quinolones, and chloramphenicol (15), AbeS is a small multidrug resistance (SMR) family pump that confers resistance to erythromycin and novobiocin, as well as low-level tolerance to aminoglycosides, quinolones, tetracycline, and trimethoprim (16), AdeABC, AdeFGH, and AdeIJK are resistance-nodulation-division (RND) family pumps that have been associated with resistance to aminoglycosides, \u03b2-lactams, fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, tigecycline, macrolides, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim (17\u201321).\n\nFurthermore, A.\n\nbaumannii is known to harbor several horizontally acquired Tet efflux pumps belonging to the MFS that confer tetracycline resistance (12, 22).\n\nWhile the antimicrobial effects of these efflux pumps have been well documented, the mechanisms by which the organism regulates their expression are only beginning to be understood.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned well-characterized efflux pumps, A.\n\nbaumannii is reported to harbor an array of putative efflux pumps that may confer antibiotic resistance (23).\n\nFor instance, the common laboratory strains A.\n\nbaumannii AYE and ATCC 17978 contain 46 and 73 genes, respectively, that are annotated as putative drug efflux pumps.\n\nIt remains to be seen if these factors do indeed modulate antibiotic tolerance or which endogenous or exogenous cues regulate their activity.\n\nNonetheless, recent studies suggest that they are likely to have clinical significance.\n\nIndeed, Hood and colleagues (24) found that 18 previously uncharacterized putative drug efflux-associated factors were significantly upregulated and conferred resistance to levofloxacin and amikacin during A.\n\nbaumannii growth under physiologically relevant salt conditions.\n\nLikewise, in another study, A.\n\nbaumannii grown in human serum was found to induce the expression of 22 putative drug efflux-associated genes and efflux-mediated tolerance to minocycline at levels that are clinically relevant (25).\n\nSuch regulated changes in efflux pump expression and activity in response to host-associated environmental cues are thought to temporarily increase the ability of a bacterium to survive antibiotic challenge and are hypothesized to allow otherwise clinically defined antibiotic susceptible strains to resist antibiotic insult; this phenomenon was recently termed adaptive efflux-mediated resistance by Fern\u00e1ndez and Hancock (26).\n\nThe current study was designed to further our understanding of the adaptive antibiotic efflux potential of A.\n\nbaumannii during growth in human serum and to identify the small-molecule inhibitors of these efflux properties.\n\nThe results revealed that in addition to minocycline, serum-induced efflux pumps are associated with the ability of A.\n\nbaumannii to tolerate ciprofloxacin, meropenem, tetracycline, and tigecycline.\n\nFurther, using a high-throughput screening strategy and secondary assays, we identified two structurally distinct classes of novel efflux pump inhibitors that restore the antibiotic susceptibility of serum-grown A.\n\nbaumannii and lack the inherent problems commonly associated with other classes of antibiotic efflux pump inhibitors, namely, mammalian cytotoxicity and calcium channel inhibition.\n\nThese compounds may represent promising structural scaffolds for the development of new classes of bacterial antibiotic efflux pump inhibitors that can be used as adjunctive therapy to potentiate the activities of current and future antibiotics for the therapeutic intervention of A.\n\nbaumannii infections.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains and growth conditions.A. baumannii strains 98-37-09, 01-12-05, 07-09-54, and 07-09-61 are clinical isolates obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and were previously described (27).\n\nPseudomonas aeruginosa strain PAO1 and Klebsiella pneumoniae strain CKP4 are prototypic laboratory strains that were generously provided by Barbara Iglewski (University of Rochester, Rochester, NY) and Thomas Russo (State University of New York, Buffalo, NY), respectively (28).\n\nAll strains were grown in either Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) or 100% human serum (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH).\n\nWhere indicated, LB or serum was supplemented with the indicated concentration of minocycline (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), ciprofloxacin (Sigma-Aldrich), meropenem (LKT Laboratories, Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN), or tigecycline (Pfizer, Groton, CT).\n\nAntibiotic susceptibility assays.The antibiotic susceptibilities of A.\n\nbaumannii and P.\n\naeruginosa grown in either LB medium or 100% human serum were measured, as previously described (25).\n\nBriefly, the indicated bacterial species/strain was grown overnight in LB medium, diluted into fresh medium (1:100 dilution), and grown to mid-exponential phase (optical density at 600 nm [OD600], 0.4 to 0.5) at 37\u00b0C, with aeration.\n\nA total of 1 \u00d7 105 CFU were transferred to individual wells of a 96-well round-bottom plate containing 100 \u03bcl of LB or 100% human serum supplemented with 2-fold increasing concentrations (0 to 2 \u03bcg ml\u22121) of minocycline, amikacin, gentamicin, kanamycin, meropenem, ceftriaxone, erythromycin, colistin, polymyxin B, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, nalidixic acid, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, tigecycline, or 0 to 16 \u03bcg ml\u22121 tetracycline and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 48 h.\n\nTo quantify the antimicrobial effects of each antibiotic toward bacteria grown in LB or serum, the well constitutes were serially diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and plated on LB agar to enumerate the CFU ml\u22121.\n\nWhere indicated, antimicrobial susceptibility assays were also performed in the presence of 50 \u03bcg ml\u22121 efflux pump inhibitors, verapamil, reserpine, or phenylalanine arginine \u03b2-naphthylamide (PA\u03b2N), or with the indicated amount of the putative efflux inhibitors Acinetobacter baumannii efflux pump inhibitor 1 (ABEPI1) [(E)-4-((4-chlorobenzylidene)amino)benezenesulfonamide] and ABEPI2 [N-tert-butyl-2-(1-tert-butyltetrazol-5-yl)sulfanylacetamide].\n\nHigh-throughput screen for A.\n\nbaumannii serum-dependent antibiotic efflux pump inhibitors.The TimTec ActiProbe-25K diversity set and Natural Products Library (29,900 compounds total; TimTec, Newark, DE) were initially screened for putative efflux pump inhibitors by identifying compounds that potentiated the antimicrobial property of a subinhibitory concentration of minocycline toward A.\n\nbaumannii grown in human serum.\n\nTo do so, A.\n\nbaumannii strain 98-37-09 was grown for 16 h in LB medium at 37\u00b0C on a rotary shaker at 225 rpm.\n\nApproximately 1 \u00d7 105 CFU were then transferred to individual wells of a 96-well round-bottom plate (Corning Costar, Tewksbury, MA) containing 100 \u03bcl of human serum supplemented with minocycline (0.5 \u03bcg ml\u22121 [0.5\u00d7 MIC in serum]) and individual members of the TimTec ActiProbe or Natural Products Library (50 \u03bcM).\n\nThe plates were then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 48 h.\n\nPutative efflux pump inhibitors were identified as compounds that inhibited A.\n\nbaumannii growth in human serum containing minocycline and were subsequently retested in triplicate, as indicated above.\n\nUntreated A.\n\nbaumannii grown in serum supplemented with minocycline \u00b1 PA\u03b2N served as positive and negative controls, respectively.\n\nTo distinguish compounds with inherent antimicrobial properties from the putative efflux pump inhibitors, the compounds were directly assessed for antibacterial activity in human serum in the absence of minocycline.\n\nTo do so, 1 \u00d7 105 CFU of A.\n\nbaumannii strain 98-37-09 were inoculated into individual wells of a microtiter plate containing 100 \u03bcl of 100% human serum supplemented with increasing concentrations of the test compound (0 to 128 \u03bcg ml\u22121) and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 48 h.\n\nThe compounds that displayed antimicrobial activity were archived, whereas those that did not exhibit direct antibacterial activity were considered putative efflux inhibitors, and the minimum effective concentration (MEC) at which they potentiated the antimicrobial activity of minocycline toward serum-grown A.\n\nbaumannii was determined.\n\nFor MEC determination, individual wells of 96-well round-bottom plates containing 100% human serum supplemented with 0.5\u00d7 the MIC of minocycline (0.5 \u03bcg ml\u22121) and increasing concentrations of test compound (0 to 128 \u03bcg ml\u22121) were inoculated with approximately 1 \u00d7 105 CFU of A.\n\nbaumannii strain 98-37-09 and incubated for 48 h at 37\u00b0C.\n\nThe MEC was defined as the lowest concentration of test compound required to inhibit the growth of A.\n\nbaumannii in serum in the presence of 0.5 \u03bcg ml\u22121 minocycline.\n\nCellular accumulation of minocycline.High-pressure liquid chromatography and triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry were used to measure the intracellular levels of minocycline in A.\n\nbaumannii during growth in human serum in the absence and presence of each putative efflux pump inhibitor.\n\nTo do so, A.\n\nbaumannii 98-37-09 was grown in 5 ml of 100% human serum supplemented with 0.5 \u03bcg ml\u22121 minocycline, in the absence and presence of 0.5\u00d7 the MEC of each putative efflux pump inhibitor (test compound) or the known efflux pump inhibitor verapamil.\n\nThe cultures were incubated for 48 h with shaking, at which point an aliquot was removed, serially diluted, and plated to determine the number of viable CFU per mixture.\n\nThe remaining cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 900 \u00d7 g at 4\u00b0C, washed twice in PBS, and mechanically lysed with a FastPrep cell disrupter (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA) for 20 s at 5 m s\u22121, and the cellular debris was pelleted via centrifugation at 900 \u00d7 g at 4\u00b0C.\n\nThe amount of minocycline present within the supernatant of the ruptured cells was measured, as previously described (29).\n\nBriefly, doxycycline (0.5 \u03bcg ml\u22121) was first added to each supernatant to serve as an internal control to account for sample-to-sample preparation variability.\n\nThe supernatant was then combined with acetonitrile (ACN) at a 1:10 ratio and centrifuged at 16,000 \u00d7 g at 4\u00b0C to collect minocycline and doxycycline.\n\nThe supernatants were discarded, and the residual liquid was evaporated in a speed vacuum for 2 h at 8,000 \u00d7 g.\n\nTo quantify the amount of antibiotics retained, the sample materials were suspended in 50% acetonitrile, filtered through a 0.2-\u03bcm low-protein binding hydrophilic membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA), and then separated on a Shimadzu high-performance liquid chromatography instrument (Fisher Scientific) using a BetaBasic C18 reverse-phase column (Thermo Scientific).\n\nSeparation was carried out with two mobile-phase solutions consisting of solution A, which was water with 0.1% formic acid, and solution B, which was 100% ACN.\n\nThe gradient profile of the chromatography runs was 0 to 0.1 min of 8% solution B, ramped up step-wise (37% to 60% solution B) from 0.1 to 6.5 min, and then holding for 1 min before ramping down from 60% to 10% from 7.5 to 8 min.\n\nThis was followed by a hold at 10% solution B for 1 min.\n\nFrom 10 to 13 min, the gradient was ramped up to 100% solution B and held until 11.5 min, was reduced to 8% solution B, and was held under these conditions for an additional 4 min.\n\nThe column was equilibrated in 8% solution B at 40\u00b0C, and the flow rate was set to 0.2 ml min\u22121.\n\nMass spectrometry analysis of the fractions was carried out using a TSQ Quantum Ultra triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).\n\nThe data were analyzed using the Xcalibur software (Thermo Scientific), and the following parameters were used to detect minocycline and the internal control doxycycline: 458.208 m/z\u2192282.971 m/z (collision energy, 43; tube lens, 119) for minocycline and 445.144 m/z\u2192266.900 m/z (collision energy, 39; tube lens, 127) for doxycycline.\n\nAnalysis of the raw data was conducted by using area under the curve calculations with the Genesis algorithm to determine the concentration in each sample.\n\nThe difference between the peak intensity and the y intercept of preestablished minocycline and doxycycline standard curves was divided by the slope of the standard curve to quantify the amount of minocycline within each sample.\n\nThe total concentration of minocycline within each cell was calculated by normalization to the number of cells within each corresponding culture.\n\nCytotoxicity assay.The human cytotoxicity of putative efflux pump inhibitors was measured alone and in combination with minocycline using MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] cell viability assays, according to the manufacturer's recommendations (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA).\n\nBriefly, human HepG2 cells were grown to approximately 1 \u00d7 106 cells per well in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and then treated with 1\u00d7 or 4\u00d7 the MEC of the indicated compound alone or in combination with 0.5 \u03bcg ml\u22121 minocycline for 24 h.\n\nCell viability was measured following the addition of the tetrazolium salt (MTT), as per the manufacturer's recommendations; the cells challenged with 50 \u03bcg ml\u22121 mitomycin C (Sigma-Aldrich) and the mock-treated cells served as positive and negative controls, respectively.\n\nEthidium bromide efflux assay.Standard bacterial ethidium bromide efflux activity assays were used to measure the efflux inhibitory properties of the compounds of interest, as previously described (18, 30\u201333).\n\nFor the assays, an overnight culture of A.\n\nbaumannii 98-37-09 was diluted (1:100) into 100% human serum or fresh LB and grown to mid-exponential phase.\n\nThe cell pellets were collected via centrifugation at 900 \u00d7 g for 20 min, washed 3\u00d7 with 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, and resuspended to an OD600 of 0.2 in sodium phosphate buffer.\n\nApproximately 1 \u00d7 106 CFU were loaded into individual wells of 96-well white-bottom plates and mixed with 10 \u03bcg ml\u22121 ethidium bromide, and ethidium fluorescence (excitation, 530 nm; emission, 600 nm) was measured every 5 min for 90 min on a SPECTRAmax5 fluorometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).\n\nTo determine if the putative efflux pump inhibitors affected ethidium bromide efflux, the cells were treated with the indicated amount of the compound of interest or the efflux pump inhibitor PA\u03b2N at 2 min after fluorescence monitoring began.\n\nThe mock-treated cells served as a negative control; plating confirmed that the test conditions used did not affect cell viability.\n\nMammalian calcium channel assays.Fluo-4 Direct calcium channel assay kits were used, according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), to determine whether the compounds of interest affect human Ca2+ channel activity.\n\nBriefly, 5 \u00d7 104 human HEK 293T embryonic kidney cells were grown in individual wells of 96-well black-walled plates (Corning Costar).\n\nNext, 2\u00d7 Fluo-4 dye supplemented with probenecid (5 mM) was added to each well and allowed to equilibrate for 1 h at 37\u00b0C.\n\nTo determine whether ABEPI1 or ABEPI2 affects Ca2+ channel activity, Fluo-4 fluorescence measurements (excitation, 495 nm; emission, 516 nm) were taken at 1-s intervals for 15 s.\n\nAt that time point, the cells were treated with either dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (mock), 50 \u03bcg ml\u22121 the Ca2+ channel inhibitor verapamil (positive control), or 1\u00d7 the MEC of ABEPI1 or ABEPI2, followed by the calcium channel stimulator carbamylcholine chloride (50 \u03bcg ml\u22121; Fisher Scientific) at 60 s, and fluorescence was measured for an additional 120 s on a FlexStation 3 benchtop multimode microplate reader (Molecular Devices).\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section RESULTS Serum-induced efflux pumps extrude multiple antibiotics.Antibiotic efflux pumps have been found to contribute to bacterial resistance to virtually every currently available antibiotic.\n\nTen A.\n\nbaumannii antibiotic efflux systems have been characterized to date, and a bioinformatics assessment of the publically available genomes suggests that the organism is likely to produce an expansive repertoire of additional efflux pumps (13\u201317, 19, 20, 23, 31\u201333).\n\nIn that regard, we previously found that A.\n\nbaumannii growth in human serum, a biologically relevant medium, induces the expression of 22 previously uncharacterized putative drug efflux pump-associated genes (see Table S1 in the supplemental material), and their expression corresponds to efflux-mediated tolerance to the antibiotic minocycline at levels correlating to patient serum levels during treatment (25).\n\nAs a means to evaluate this phenomenon further, we assessed whether A.\n\nbaumannii growth in serum elicits drug efflux-mediated tolerance to other tetracyclines, quinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and nalidixic acid), aminoglycosides (amikacin, gentamicin, and kanamycin), a carbapenem (meropenem), a cephalosporin (ceftriaxone), a macrolide (erythromycin), polypeptides (colistin and polymyxin B), a sulfonamide (sulfamethoxazole), glycylcycline (tigecycline), and trimethoprim.\n\nTo do so, A.\n\nbaumannii 98-37-09 was cultured in LB or 100% human serum in the presence of increasing concentrations of each antibiotic, and the antimicrobial effects of each antibiotic were measured by plating for CFU.\n\nAs expected based on our previous results (25), A.\n\nbaumannii 98-37-09 cells grown in human serum were significantly (P < 0.01) less susceptible to minocycline at concentrations of \u22650.25 \u03bcg ml\u22121 than were the cells cultured in LB (Fig.\n\n1A).\n\nFurther, minocycline susceptibility was restored to the cells grown in serum supplemented with the known efflux pump inhibitor PA\u03b2N, suggesting that the observed serum-associated minocycline tolerance was efflux mediated as opposed to being caused by antibiotic inactivation by the serum components.\n\nSimilar susceptibility assays using other antibiotics revealed that this serum-associated adaptive resistance phenomenon is not minocycline specific.\n\nIndeed, serum-grown 98-37-09 cells were less susceptible to the antibiotic ciprofloxacin at concentrations of \u22641 \u03bcg ml\u22121 than were LB-grown cells; ciprofloxacin susceptibility was restored to the cells grown in serum supplemented with the known efflux pump inhibitor reserpine (Fig.\n\n1B).\n\nLikewise, A.\n\nbaumannii grown in human serum displayed efflux-mediated tolerance to tetracycline at antibiotic concentrations of \u22652 \u03bcg ml\u22121 (Fig.\n\n1C).\n\nMore specifically, the treatment of LB-grown A.\n\nbaumannii with 4 to 16 \u03bcg ml\u22121 tetracycline reduced cell viability to undetectable levels (<1 \u00d7 101 CFU), whereas the cells grown in serum displayed considerable antibiotic tolerance, between 1 \u00d7 106 and 1 \u00d7 104 CFU.\n\nSerum-grown A.\n\nbaumannii tetracycline susceptibility was partially restored in the presence of the drug efflux pump inhibitor PA\u03b2N, suggesting that efflux pumps, in part, modulate the tetracycline tolerance of an organism during serum growth.\n\nSimilar phenotypes were also observed for the representatives of three of 11 previously characterized A.\n\nbaumannii lineages evaluated (27), indicating that serum-associated efflux pump-mediated minocycline and ciprofloxacin tolerance is a semiconserved A.\n\nbaumannii response that is presumably dependent on the genetic composition of the organism evaluated (data not shown).\n\nView larger version: In this window In a new window Download as PowerPoint Slide FIG 1 Antimicrobial effects of minocycline, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, and tigecycline toward LB- and serum-grown A.\n\nbaumannii.\n\n(A) Plotted are the CFU of strain 98-37-09 following incubation in LB or serum (with/without the efflux pump inhibitor PA\u03b2N) supplemented with 0 to 2 \u03bcg ml\u22121 of minocycline.\n\n(B) CFU of strain 98-37-09 following incubation in LB or serum (with/without the efflux pump inhibitor reserpine) supplemented with 0 to 1 \u03bcg ml\u22121 of

CFU of strain 01-12-05 after incubation in LB or serum (with/without the efflux pump inhibitor reserpine) supplemented with 0 to 4 ml\u22121 of tigecycline.\n\nThe mean CFU \u00b1 standard deviations are plotted on the y axis, and antibiotic concentration is indicated on the x axis; the asterisks indicate statistically significant differences in CFU between growth in LB and serum (Student's t test; *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001).\n\nWhile we did not observe significant differences between the susceptibilities of serum- and LB-grown 98-37-09 cells and those of other classes of antibiotics tested, it was observed during the course of our investigations that strains representing seven of the 11 other lineages tested displayed various but significantly increased efflux-mediated tolerance to the antibiotic tigecycline during serum growth (representative results shown in Fig.\n\n1D).\n\nAs an example, tigecycline displayed clear antimicrobial activity toward A.\n\nbaumannii 01-12-05 during growth in LB medium at concentrations of \u22651 \u03bcg ml\u22121, but the strain appeared to be highly resistant to the antibiotic during growth in serum.\n\nSusceptibility was partially restored by adding the efflux pump inhibitor reserpine, suggesting that serum-associated efflux pump activity contributes to the ability of a strain to tolerate tigecycline during growth in serum.\n\nThe observed serum-dependent efflux pump-mediated antibiotic tolerance may, in part, account for the clinical failure of antibiotics toward clinically defined susceptible A.\n\nbaumannii strains; during adaptation to host-associated environmental conditions, such as serum, the organism may induce efflux pumps that allow clinically defined antibiotic-susceptible organisms to tolerate antibiotic challenge in vivo.\n\nAccordingly, adjunctive therapy with corresponding efflux pump inhibitors may provide a valuable strategy for limiting antibiotic tolerance within the host and, consequently, be an attractive therapeutic approach for both current and future antibiotics.\n\nHigh-throughput screening for agents that potentiate antimicrobial activity of minocycline toward serum-grown A.\n\nbaumannii.As a means of identifying new chemical classes of A.\n\nbaumannii antibiotic efflux inhibitors, we exploited the finding that during growth in human serum, A.\n\nbaumannii expresses efflux pumps that mediate cellular tolerance to minocycline (25) (Fig.\n\n1A).\n\nAccordingly, the 29,900-member TimTec ActiProbe small-molecule library and Natural Product Library were screened for agents that eliminate the tolerance of A.\n\nbaumannii to minocycline during serum growth.\n\nTo do so, approximately 1 \u00d7 105 A.\n\nbaumannii 98-37-09 cells were inoculated into individual wells of a microtiter plate containing 100% human serum supplemented with 0.5 \u03bcg ml\u22121 minocycline (0.5\u00d7 the serum MIC).\n\nA total of 50 \u03bcM each library member was added, the plates were incubated for 48 h at 37\u00b0C, and growth was measured as a function of turbidity.\n\nMost compounds (99.6% [29,806 compounds]) did not affect the growth of the organism, whereas 94 compounds (0.4%) inhibited the ability of the strain to grow in serum supplemented with minocycline.\n\nRepeat testing in which the well constituents were serially diluted and plated on LB agar plates verified that 85 compounds did indeed limit A.\n\nbaumannii growth in serum supplemented with minocycline, resulting in a 2- to 6-log reduction in the number of viable CFU in comparison to the cells treated with minocycline alone.\n\nTo distinguish whether compounds of interest potentiate the activity of minocycline as opposed to displaying antibacterial properties on their own, each compound was subsequently evaluated for antimicrobial activity toward A.\n\nbaumannii in serum or LB in the absence of minocycline.\n\nTwelve of the 85 compounds tested (12.7%) exhibited antimicrobial activity toward A.\n\nbaumannii grown in serum and/or LB in the absence of minocycline and may represent novel antimicrobial agents (data not shown).\n\nThe remaining 73 compounds did not display antimicrobial activity in the absence of minocycline, suggesting that a subset of these compounds may represent efflux pump inhibitors that potentiate the antimicrobial activity of minocycline toward serum-grown A.\n\nbaumannii.\n\nAccordingly, their minimum effective concentration (MEC) was defined as a means both to rank the compounds based on their potency and also as a prerequisite for more extensive characterization, as described below.\n\nTo define the MEC of each compound, A.\n\nbaumannii 98-37-09 was inoculated into individual wells of a microtiter plate containing 100% human serum supplemented with 0.5 \u03bcg ml\u22121 minocycline and increasing concentrations (0 to 125 \u03bcg ml\u22121) of the test compound, and it was then incubated for 48 h.\n\nThe smallest amount of compound required to potentiate the antimicrobial activity of minocycline, as defined by growth inhibition, was defined as the MEC.\n\nPlating confirmed that the addition of 1\u00d7 the MEC of each compound elicited a \u22651.9-log reduction in A.\n\nbaumannii cells grown in serum supplemented with minocycline alone (see Table S2 in the supplemental material).\n\nA.\n\nbaumannii minocycline accumulation.As an initial means of determining whether the compounds of interest displayed characteristics expected of an A.\n\nbaumannii efflux pump inhibitor, and simultaneously prioritizing compounds for further characterization, we considered that efflux pump inhibition would lead to intracellular antibiotic accumulation compared to that in the cells in which efflux was active.\n\nAccordingly, triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry was used to measure the cellular antibiotic concentration of A.\n\nbaumannii cells grown in human serum supplemented with 0.5 \u03bcg ml\u22121 minocycline in the absence and presence of 0.5\u00d7 the MEC test compound.\n\nThese concentrations were used, and the plating of each culture validated that the conditions did not affect A.\n\nbaumannii viability (data not shown).\n\nDuring growth in serum (efflux active conditions), the cellular minocycline concentration was determined to be 1.58 \u00d7 10\u221210 femtomoles (fmol) per bacterial cell, whereas the addition of the known efflux pump inhibitor verapamil increased the cellular concentration nearly 1,000-fold (3.56 \u00d7 10\u22127 fmol cell\u22121), indicating that the approach is appropriate for measuring efflux pump-dependent cellular antibiotic accumulation.\n\nAs shown in Fig.\n\n2, while virtually all of the compounds evaluated appeared to induce minocycline accumulation compared to that in mock-treated cells, 41 compounds stimulated minocycline accumulation within serum-grown A.\n\nbaumannii cells to levels equaling or exceeding that of the known antibiotic efflux pump inhibitor verapamil, and these were considered to be highest priority agents that presumably include efflux inhibitors and compounds that lead to antibiotic accumulation via unappreciated means.\n\nRegardless of the mechanism, these 41 compounds were considered to be putatively clinically valuable agents that potentiate the antimicrobial activity and cellular accumulation of minocycline toward A.\n\nbaumannii in serum and were carried forward for further characterization.\n\nView larger version: In this

98-37-09 in serum supplemented with 0.5 \u03bcg ml\u22121 minocycline (y axis) in the absence (white bar) or presence (gray bar) of the efflux pump inhibitor verapamil, or the presence of 0.5\u00d7 the minimum effective concentration of the indicated putative efflux pump inhibitor (x axis).\n\nThe dashed gray line represents the concentration of minocycline per cell grown in human serum supplemented with minocycline and verapamil for comparison.\n\nHuman cytotoxicity measures.Given that our overarching goal was to identify therapeutically relevant novel compounds for future medicinal chemistry-based improvement and refinement, we considered that the most desirable compounds would display little or no human cytotoxicity.\n\nIndeed, while PA\u03b2N has proven to be a valuable bacterial drug efflux inhibitor tool/compound in the laboratory setting, the compound displays toxicity at concentrations required for antimicrobial efficacy in the host and, consequently, has limited therapeutic promise (34).\n\nThus, to distinguish putatively nontoxic from cytotoxic compounds, conventional 3-(4,5-dimethythiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) cell viability assays were performed for each compound of interest at 1\u00d7 and 4\u00d7 their MEC.\n\nAs shown in Table S2 in the supplemental material, 19 (46.3%) of the compounds tested elicited significant toxicity toward HepG2 cells, which was defined as <75% cellular survival during 48-h treatment at 4\u00d7 the MEC, and these compounds were deprioritized.\n\nConversely, 22 (53.6%) compounds displayed \u226575% survival (75.1% to 100%) and were considered to exhibit either no or low-level human HepG2 cytotoxicity; the low-level cytotoxicity may be reduced by future medicinal chemistry campaigns.\n\nIt should be noted that 75% human cell survival was used as a culling criterion, because it approximates the toxicity measures of the antibiotic minocycline when tested alone under these assay conditions (77.9% HepG2 survival at 2 \u03bcg ml\u22121).\n\nThus, we expect that molecules displaying human cytotoxicity measures correlating with minocycline under these assay conditions represent the most promising scaffolds for future medicinal chemistry-based optimization.\n\nSpectrum of activity.As a means to further prioritize nontoxic compounds of interest based on their therapeutic promise, we considered that broad-spectrum antimicrobial efflux pump inhibitors may be more clinically valuable than narrow-spectrum agents that potentiate the activity of only a limited number of antibiotics or that display activity toward a single bacterial species.\n\nAs described above, in addition to minocycline, A.\n\nbaumannii growth in human serum facilitates the efflux and the tolerance of ciprofloxacin in an organism (Fig.\n\n1B).\n\nConsequently, we evaluated whether each compound potentiated the activity of ciprofloxacin toward serum-grown cells.\n\nTo do so, 1 \u00d7 105 CFU A.\n\nbaumannii 98-37-09 was inoculated into individual wells of microtiter plates containing 100% human serum supplemented with 0.125 \u03bcg ml\u22121 ciprofloxacin and 0\u00d7, 1\u00d7, or 2\u00d7 the MEC of the compound, as defined by the lowest concentration needed to potentiate the antimicrobial effects of minocycline (above).\n\nThe plates were incubated for 48 h, at which point the ability of each compound to potentiate ciprofloxacin was measured as the growth inhibition.\n\nNineteen of the compounds evaluated did not affect the tolerance of the organism to ciprofloxacin under these conditions, suggesting that they are narrow-spectrum agents that limit minocycline efflux but not ciprofloxacin efflux, and these were deprioritized.\n\nConversely, 3 compounds potentiated the antimicrobial activity of ciprofloxacin, suggesting that they represent broad-spectrum antibiotic drug efflux pump inhibitors.\n\nPlating confirmed that when administered in combination with ciprofloxacin, each compound reduced A.\n\nbaumannii viability \u22651.5 log at 1\u00d7 the MEC of the compound compared to that of the cells treated with ciprofloxacin alone (Fig.\n\n3A; see also Table S2 in the supplemental material).\n\nView larger version: In this window In a new window Download as PowerPoint Slide FIG 3 Spectrum of activity.\n\n(A) CFU of strain 98-37-09 grown in human serum supplemented with 0.125 \u03bcg ml\u22121 ciprofloxacin in the absence or presence of 1\u00d7 the MEC of the putative efflux pump inhibitor ST009675 (2 \u03bcg ml\u22121), ST058165 (32 \u03bcg ml\u22121), or ST060273 (32 \u03bcg ml\u22121); error bars indicate the standard deviations.\n\n(B) Mean CFU measures \u00b1 standard deviations for P.\n\naeruginosa PAO1 following incubation in LB or serum with or without the efflux pump inhibitor PA\u03b2N, ST009675 (2 \u03bcg ml\u22121), or ST060273 (32 \u03bcg ml\u22121) supplemented with 0 to 2 \u03bcg ml\u22121 of ciprofloxacin.\n\n(C) Structures of ABEPI1 (ST009675) and ABEPI2 (ST060273).\n\nDuring the course of our studies, we also investigated whether the Gram-negative pathogens K.\n\npneumoniae and P.\n\naeruginosa exhibit antibiotic tolerance to minocycline and/or ciprofloxacin during growth in human serum.\n\nWhile K.\n\npneumoniae strain CKP4 did not, it was found that serum-grown P.\n\naeruginosa PAO1 cells exhibit efflux-mediated tolerance to ciprofloxacin, as described below.\n\nThus, as an additional means of evaluating the spectrum of activity and simultaneously identifying the highest priority compounds of interest that potentiate the activity of antibiotics across bacterial species, we evaluated whether the aforementioned three putative broad-spectrum A.\n\nbaumannii efflux pump inhibitors also inhibited P.\n\naeruginosa serum-dependent ciprofloxacin tolerance.\n\nTo do so, PAO1 was inoculated into individual wells of a microtiter plate containing 100% human serum supplemented with 1\u00d7 the MEC of test compound and increasing concentrations of ciprofloxacin (0 to 2 \u03bcg ml\u22121), and cell viability was measured.\n\nThe results revealed that two of the three putative broad-spectrum efflux pump inhibitors also potentiated the activity of ciprofloxacin toward serum-grown P.\n\naeruginosa (Fig.\n\n3B), suggesting that these compounds, ABEPI1 and ABEPI1 (Fig.\n\n3C), represent broad-spectrum agents that may potentiate the antimicrobial properties of antibiotics toward at least two bacterial species of immediate health care concern, A.\n\nbaumannii and P.\n\naeruginosa.\n\nPA\u03b2N alone (i.e., in the absence of ciprofloxacin) did not display antimicrobial properties toward serum-grown PAO1 cells under these assay conditions (data not shown).\n\nABEPI1 and ABEPI2 inhibit A.\n\nbaumannii efflux properties.To distinguish whether the antimicrobial potentiation of ABEPI1 and ABEPI2 correlates to the inhibition of the efflux properties of A.\n\nbaumannii, conventional ethidium bromide efflux assays were performed in the presence and absence of each compound, as previously described (18, 30\u201333).\n\nThe assay is predicated upon the fluorescent properties of ethidium bromide during intercalation into cellular nucleic acids, whereby efflux active cells display limited intracellular ethidium bromide accumulation and, consequently, low fluorescence.\n\nConversely, efflux inhibition leads to increased cellular ethidium bromide levels and correspondingly high fluorescence relative to that of efflux-proficient cells.\n\nAs shown in Fig.\n\n4, the mock-treated cells displayed a low-level ethidium bromide fluorescence signal that slowly increased during the course of the experiment, presumably reflecting the slow accumulation of dye over time despite efflux pump activity.\n\nConversely, efflux-deficient PA\u03b2N-treated cells exhibited significantly increased cellular ethidium bromide accumulation compared to that in mock-treated cells, confirming that the assay conditions were appropriate for measuring the efflux properties of A.\n\nbaumannii cells.\n\nLikewise, both ABEPI1 and ABEPI2 displayed a significantly increased signal compared to that of the mock-treated cells at all measured time points, indicating that they act as A.\n\nbaumannii efflux pump inhibitors.\n\nMore specifically, APEPI1 dramatically increased cellular fluorescence to levels exceeding that of PA\u03b2N within the first 20 min of treatment, at which point the potency of the compound appeared to level off.\n\nThe APEPI2 treatment measures were essentially identical to those of PA\u03b2N until approximately 35 min posttreatment, at which point efflux inhibition appeared to drop below the PA\u03b2N levels, although the observed differences were not considered significantly different.\n\nThus, ABEPI1 and ABEPI2 appear to represent novel A.\n\nbaumannii drug efflux inhibitors.\n\nView

strain 98-37-09 following growth in human serum and treatment with PA\u03b2N (10 \u03bcg ml\u22121; white squares), ABEPI1 (ST009675; 2 \u03bcg ml\u22121; gray triangles), or ABEPI2 (32 \u03bcg ml\u22121; gray X).\n\nThe mock-treated cells are also shown (black diamonds).\n\nMammalian Ca2+ channel blocking assays.In considering whether ABEPI1 and/or ABEPI2 represent attractive antibiotic efflux pumps worthy of future medicinal chemistry-based improvement, we were cognizant of the fact that many laboratory bacterial efflux inhibitor tool compounds cannot be used in the clinical setting, because they limit mammalian ion channel activity.\n\nVerapamil is one such agent, which effectively limits bacterial antibiotic efflux pumps but also elicits human neurotoxicity due to the inhibition of host Ca2+ channels (35).\n\nThus, we measured the effects of ABEPI1 and ABEPI2 on mammalian calcium channel functions using Fluo-4 Direct calcium channel assay kits, in which the dye Fluo-4 was used to measure changes in mammalian cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels in response to the calcium channel stimulator carbachol in the absence and presence of test compound.\n\nFigure 5A shows the profile of human embryonic kidney (HEK 293T) intracellular Ca2+ levels prior to and following the addition of carbachol, which stimulates endoplasmic calcium-channel activity and, consequently, the release of Ca2+ into the cytoplasm.\n\nAs expected, carbachol treatment induced an approximately 2.3-fold increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels.\n\nConversely, the treatment of HEK 293T cells with the known calcium channel blocker verapamil virtually eliminated Ca2+ channel activity and cytoplasmic accumulation, indicating that the system was appropriate for measuring mammalian cytoplasmic channel activity and inhibition (Fig.\n\n5B).\n\nAs shown in Fig.\n\n5C and D, HEK 293T treatment with 1\u00d7 or 4\u00d7 the MEC (not shown) of either ABEPI1 or ABEPI2 did not appear to significantly affect mammalian cell Ca2+ channel stimulation in response to carbachol.\n\nView larger version: In this window In a new window Download as PowerPoint Slide FIG 5 Mammalian calcium channel inhibition assays.\n\n(A) Cytoplasmic Ca2+ measures of mock-treated cells pre- and posttreatment with carbachol (60 s) (gray arrow).\n\n(B to D) Same as panel A except that cells were treated with verapamil (50

it appears as though ABEPI1 and ABEPI2 represent novel and structurally distinct molecules that potentiate the activities of antibiotics toward serum-grown bacterial cells by inhibiting the drug efflux properties of an organism, leading to cellular antibiotic accumulation and, consequently, antimicrobial effects.\n\nMoreover, the compounds did not display significant human cytotoxicity measures or Ca2+ channel blocking activity that has plagued the development of antibiotic drug efflux inhibitors.\n\nSuch compounds may represent attractive starting scaffolds for medicinal chemistry-based improvement and refinement, with the ultimate goal of creating adjunctive efflux pump inhibitors to be used in combination with current antibiotics for improving the treatment of bacterial infections.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section DISCUSSION Antibiotic resistance is a general term used to describe the phenomenon whereby antibiotics used to treat a bacterial pathogen are rendered useless or less effective by the target organism.\n\nThe so-called bacterial drug efflux pumps have been shown to contribute to antibiotic resistance by modulating the cellular concentration of a given antibiotic within bacterial cells and can generally be divided into five classes of transporters: small multidrug resistance (SMR) pumps of the drug/metabolite transporter superfamily, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, the major facilitator superfamily (MFS), the resistance-nodulation-division (RND) superfamily, and multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) transporters (see reference 26 for a recent review).\n\nWhile some members of these families selectively extrude specific antibiotics, the majority efflux a variety of antimicrobial agents.\n\nFor instance, the A.\n\nbaumannii MATE family transporter AbeM is believed to efflux fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, quinolones, chloramphenicol, and erythromycin (15).\n\nThus, AbeM inhibitors may be valuable therapeutic agents that restore the utility of several antibiotic classes.\n\nHowever, such a strategy is complicated by the fact that many antibiotics are extruded by multiple efflux pumps.\n\nThus, in considering the development of an antimicrobial efflux inhibitor program, clinically relevant inhibitors must limit the activities of multiple efflux pumps as a prerequisite for efficacy.\n\nA.\n\nbaumannii harbors representatives of all the major efflux families, and this is thought to contribute to the antimicrobial resistance of the organism, a phenotype that has, in part, led to its designation as one of the six bacterial ESKAPE (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, K.\n\npneumoniae, A.\n\nbaumannii, P.\n\naeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) pathogens of immediate health care concern (36).\n\nWhile much has been learned about the substrates affected by previously characterized efflux pumps, studies regarding their expression and biological consequences are in their infancy.\n\nLikewise, bioinformatics analysis has revealed that the organism is likely to express a plethora of previously uncharacterized factors that may also contribute to clinical antibiotic failure.\n\nVentilator-associated pneumonia and bacteremia are the two most severe types of A.\n\nbaumannii infection, both of which are thought to include dissemination of the organism to visceral organs via the circulatory system (1, 2, 6, 37).\n\nFor that reason, much effort has been devoted toward defining the cellular components of the organism that modulate growth and persistence in the blood by using human serum as a convenient growth medium for such studies.\n\nIn that regard, several A.\n\nbaumannii virulence factors, including phospholipase D (PLD), penicillin binding protein 7/8, K1 capsule polysaccharide, and outer membrane protein A (OmpA), have been shown to augment the ability of the organism to survive in human serum and to contribute to its ability to cause disease in animal models of infection, validating serum as a biologically relevant medium for A.\n\nbaumannii study (27, 38\u201341).\n\nMore recently, a transcriptional profiling-based study revealed that during growth in human serum, A.\n\nbaumannii differentially expresses several putative virulence factors.\n\nPerhaps most strikingly, that study also showed that serum growth induces high-level expression of \u226522 previously uncharacterized putative drug efflux-associated proteins and corresponds to the efflux-mediated resistance of the organism to the antibiotic minocycline in serum (25).\n\nSuch a phenomenon was recently termed adaptive resistance, a connotation used to describe processes by which clinically defined susceptible bacterial species temporally alter gene expression in response to an environmental cue(s) in a manner that confers tolerance to a given antibacterial agent (26).\n\nOne of the goals of the immediate work was to expand our understanding of the adaptive efflux-mediated antibiotic resistance potential of A.\n\nbaumannii during growth in human serum.\n\nThe results presented here indicate that serum growth-associated antibiotic efflux is conserved across all genetic lineages that we have evaluated thus far, although strain-to-strain differences clearly do occur in terms of the specific antibiotics extruded.\n\nFor instance, the A.\n\nbaumannii clinical isolate 98-37-09, which was used for most of these studies, displays tolerance to minocycline, tetracycline, and ciprofloxacin during growth in serum.\n\nWhile serum growth-associated minocycline resistance has also been observed for a subset of the strains evaluated, it is not completely conserved across isolates.\n\nFor instance, the serum growth of strain 07-09-54 does not exhibit resistance to minocycline but does display efflux-mediated high-level tolerance to meropenem (data not shown).\n\nLikewise, strain 98-37-09 does not exhibit serum-dependent tigecycline tolerance, but seven representatives of the other 11 lineages evaluated do.\n\nTaken together, these results suggest that during serum growth, A.\n\nbaumannii has the capacity to express a multitude of antibiotic efflux pumps that confer antibiotic resistance, but tolerance is dependent on the genetic composition and, consequently, the efflux pump repertoire of the strain evaluated.\n\nNotably, the same phenomenon was observed for the prototypical P.\n\naeruginosa laboratory strain PAO1, which displayed efflux-mediated tolerance to ciprofloxacin during serum growth comparison to that of the laboratory medium.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether this correlates to other P.\n\naeruginosa strains or other antibiotics.\n\nLikewise, it is not yet clear which serum-dependent factors activate antibiotic efflux.\n\nHowever, the efflux of antibiotics is presumably a by-product of the transporters themselves, which are likely functioning to aid in cellular adaptation to nutrient-limiting conditions.\n\nBy extension, one would predict that other host-associated environments are likely to also elicit such a phenotype, upregulating either the efflux pumps orchestrating serum antibiotic tolerance and/or other so-called antibiotic efflux pumps.\n\nIn support of that hypothesis, it has been shown that the growth of A.\n\nbaumannii in physiologically relevant salt concentrations induces antibiotic efflux-mediated tolerance to the antibiotics amikacin and levofloxacin (24).\n\nGiven the biological importance of these findings, we reasoned that small-molecule inhibitors of serum-associated antibiotic efflux functions would represent valuable therapeutics to be used in combination with current and possibly future antibiotics.\n\nSuch agents would potentiate the antimicrobial agents despite the efflux potential of A.\n\nbaumannii in serum, thereby improving the potency of such antibiotics.\n\nThus, a whole-cell high-throughput assay was performed to identify agents that potentiate the antimicrobial activity of a subinhibitory concentration of minocycline toward serum-grown cells, with the expectation that a subset of these compounds would represent serum-associated minocycline efflux pump inhibitors.\n\nOur screening campaign and secondary assays identified two structurally distinct compounds, ABEPI1 and ABEPI2, which display the early characteristics of promising A.\n\nbaumannii serum-associated efflux pump inhibitors.\n\nBoth compounds restore the antimicrobial activities of minocycline and ciprofloxacin toward serum-grown A.\n\nbaumannii but did not affect the antibiotic susceptibilities of the LB-grown cells, suggesting that they affect serum-associated efflux factors.\n\nFurther, both compounds limit the efflux properties of the organism, as measured in standard ethidium bromide assays, and lead to minocycline accumulation within treated cells.\n\nMoreover, neither compound displayed cytotoxicity toward human cells or human Ca2+ channel inhibitory activities, two issues that have limited the development of other bacterial efflux pump inhibitors.\n\nSulfonamide is a convenient and widely used functional group in medicinal chemistry that improves the physicochemical properties, such as solubility, of small-molecule organic scaffolds, and it has been exploited in antibacterial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer agent development (reviewed in reference 42).\n\nIn that regard, Acinetobacter baumannii efflux pump inhibitor 1 (ABEPI1) [(E)-4-((4-chlorobenzylidene)amino)benezenesulfonamide] is a sulfonamide derivative that does not display antimicrobial activity on its own but strongly potentiates the activities of minocycline and ciprofloxacin, leads to minocycline accumulation within bacterial cells, and has low cytotoxicity toward human cells.\n\nTwenty structurally similar analogs were found in our screening campaign to be putative efflux pump inhibitors (see Table S2 in the supplemental material), affording some insight into a preliminary structure-activity relationship for ABEPI1.\n\nCertain analogs showed that substitutions at the 4-position of the benzylidene influence the activity of the chemical series.\n\nThe 4-methylbenzylidene analog increased the MEC 2-fold and displayed a 100,000-fold reduction in the accumulation of minocycline within A.\n\nbaumannii cells.\n\nThe 4-ethylbenzylidene analog exhibited reduced activity as well, as measured by an 8-fold increase in the MEC, and a roughly 30-fold reduction in minocycline accumulation in comparison to that with EPI1.\n\nThe 4-bromobenzylidene analog has only about a 5-fold decrease in minocycline accumulation and has the same MEC as EPI1, indicating that certain halogens may have increased activity over hydrocarbons in this position.\n\nThe 4-fluorobenzylidene, in contrast with the other two halogens, shows a 40-fold reduction in minocycline accumulation and a 32-fold increase in MEC.\n\nOther functional groups in this position also displayed measurable effects on activity: the 4-ethoxybenzylidene and 4-(dimethylamino)benzylidene analogs both had increased MEC values, decreased minocycline accumulation, and increased toxicity.\n\nClearly, additional analoging is required to develop a refined structure-activity relationship (SAR), but those tested thus far indicate the 4-substituted benzylidenes to be at least one path to improving upon the scaffold for a more effective ABEPI1-derived efflux pump inhibitor.\n\nIn comparison to ABEPI1, ABEPI2 [N-tert-butyl-2-(1-tert-butyltetrazol-5-yl)sulfanylacetamide] appears to be less potent, with a relatively high MEC of 32 \u03bcg ml\u22121; however, it also displays promising activities, leading to an accumulation of 6.84 \u00d7 10\u22126 fmol of minocycline cell\u22121, potentiating the activity of ciprofloxacin toward both A.\n\nbaumannii and P.\n\naeruginosa, having low cytotoxicity toward human cells, and inhibiting efflux pump activity.\n\nAdditionally, the compound offers a scaffold amenable to possible structural alterations that in future studies might lead to analogs that further improve the efficacy of the compound.\n\nWhile ABEPI1 and ABEPI2 exhibit similar antibiotic potentiation profiles with regard to minocycline and ciprofloxacin, early extended-spectrum-of-activity studies indicate that they also display differing activities and consequently are both likely to target a common efflux pump (or set), but they also affect differing subsets of antibiotic efflux pumps and, consequently, display broad-spectrum activity.\n\nMore specifically, ABEPI1 is capable of improving the activity of tigecycline toward the carbapenem-resistant A.\n\nbaumannii strain 07-09-61 to levels equaling that of PA\u03b2N, whereas ABEPI2 does not improve the activity of tigecycline (Fig.\n\n6A).\n\nConversely, ABEPI2 was found to improve the activity of tobramycin toward P.\n\naeruginosa PAO1 during growth in human serum to levels equaling that with PA\u03b2N (Fig.\n\n6B), but ABEPI1 did not demonstrate tobramycin-potentiating activity (Fig.\n\n6B).\n\nView larger version: In this window In a new window Download as PowerPoint Slide FIG 6 Differential antibiotic potentiation

least four biological replicates.\n\nTaken together, the results of these studies indicate that A.\n\nbaumannii and presumably P.\n\naeruginosa impart adaptive efflux resistance mechanisms during growth in human serum that may, in part, contribute to antibiotic treatment failure toward laboratory-defined susceptible strains.\n\nFurther, ABEPI1 and ABEPI2 may represent attractive compounds for future medicinal chemistry-based campaigns designed to limit Gram-negative bacterial efflux.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was supported in part by National Institute of

{"content": "AbstractTop of pageAbstractResumenMethodsResultsDiscussionLimitationsConclusionsReferencesBackgroundEarly antibiotics reduce mortality in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.\n\nRecent work demonstrated that women experience greater delays to antibiotic administration, but it is unknown if this relationship remains after adjusting for factors such as source of infection.ObjectivesThe objective was to investigate whether gender and/or source of infection are associated with delays to antibiotics in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock.MethodsThis was a retrospective, observational study in an urban academic emergency department and national Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) database study site.\n\nConsecutive patients age 18 years and older admitted to intensive care with severe sepsis or septic shock and entered into the SSC database from October 2005 to March 2012 were included.\n\nTwo trained research assistants, blinded to the primary outcome, used a standardized abstraction form to obtain patient demographic and clinical data, including the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores and comorbidities.\n\nTime to first antibiotic and presumed source of infection were extracted from the SSC database.\n\nUnivariate analyses were performed with Pearson chi-square tests and t-tests.\n\nLinear regression was performed with time to first antibiotic as the primary outcome.\n\nCovariates, chosen a priori by study authors, included age, race, ethnicity, source of infection, SOFA score, and lactate.ResultsA total of 771 patients were included.\n\nWomen were 45.3% of the sample, the mean age was 66 years (95% confidence interval [CI] = 65.1 to 67.5 years), 19.4% were nonwhite, and 8% were Hispanic.\n\nMean time to first antibiotic was 153 minutes (95% CI = 143 to 163 minutes) for men and 184 minutes (95% CI = 171 to 197 minutes) for women (p < 0.001).\n\nThe urinary tract was source of infection for 35.2% of women (95% CI = 30.2% to 40.3%) versus 23.7% (95% CI = 19.6% to 27.8%) of men.\n\nPneumonia was present in 46.9% of men (95% CI = 42.1% to 51.7%) versus 35.8% (95% CI = 30.8% to 40.8%) of women.\n\nThe mean time to antibiotics in women was longer than in men (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.07 to 1.30), even after adjusting for age, race, ethnicity, presumed source of infection, SOFA score, and lactate (p = 0.001).\n\nThose with pneumonia compared to other infections received antibiotics faster (aOR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.66 to 0.81).\n\nThere was no significant association between other sources of infection and time to antibiotics in either univariate or multivariate analysis.ConclusionsWomen experience longer delays to initial antibiotics among patients with severe sepsis or septic shock, even after adjusting for infectious source.\n\nPneumonia was associated with shorter times to antibiotic administration.\n\nFuture research is necessary to investigate contributors to delayed antibiotic administration in women.ResumenIntroducci\u00f3nLa administraci\u00f3n de antibi\u00f3ticos de forma precoz reduce la mortalidad en los pacientes con

relaci\u00f3n permanece tras ajustar por otros factores como el foco de la infecci\u00f3n.ObjetivosInvestigar si el g\u00e9nero y/o el foco de la infecci\u00f3n se asocian con retrasos en la administraci\u00f3n de antibi\u00f3ticos en los pacientes con sepsis grave o shock s\u00e9ptico.Metodolog\u00edaEstudio observacional retrospectivo en un servicio de urgencias hospitalario (SUH) universitario y urbano y en la Base de Datos nacional de la Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC).\n\nSe incluyeron los pacientes consecutivos de 18 o m\u00e1s a\u00f1os de edad ingresados en la unidad de cuidados intensivos con sepsis grave o shock s\u00e9ptico y que se introdujeron en la base de datos de SSC de octubre de 2005 a marzo de 2012.\n\nDos investigadores formados, enmascarados al resultado principal, utilizaron un formulario resumido estandarizado para obtener los datos demogr\u00e1ficos y cl\u00ednicos del paciente, que inclu\u00eda las puntuaciones del Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) y las comorbilidades.\n\nSe extrajo de la base de datos de la SCC el tiempo para la administraci\u00f3n del primer antibi\u00f3tico y el posible foco de la infecci\u00f3n.\n\nSe realiz\u00f3 un an\u00e1lisis univariado con los tests de la t de Student y la ji al cuadrado.\n\nSe llev\u00f3 a cabo una regresi\u00f3n lineal con el tiempo del primer antibi\u00f3tico como resultado principal.\n\nLas covariables, elegidas a priori por los autores del estudio, incluyeron la edad, la raza, el foco de infecci\u00f3n, la puntuaci\u00f3n del SOFA y el lactato.ResultadosSe incluyeron 771 pacientes.\n\nLas mujeres fueron un 45,3% de la muestra, con una edad media de 66 a\u00f1os (IC 95% = 65,1 a 67,5 a\u00f1os), un 19,4% fueron de raza no blanca y un 8% hisp\u00e1nicas.\n\nEl tiempo medio de administraci\u00f3n del primer antibi\u00f3tico fue 153 minutos (IC95% = 143 a 163 minutos) para los varones y 184 minutos (IC 95% = 171 a 197 minutos) para las mujeres (p <0,001).\n\nLa infecci\u00f3n del tracto urinario fue el foco de infecci\u00f3n para un 35,2% de las mujeres (IC95% = 30,2% a 40,3%) y para un 23,7% (IC95% = 19,6% a 27,8%) de los varones.\n\nLa neumon\u00eda estuvo presente en un 46,9% de los varones (IC95% = 42,1% a 51,7%) y un 35,8% (IC95% 30,8% a 40,8%) de las mujeres.\n\nLa media de tiempo de administraci\u00f3n de la primera dosis de antibi\u00f3tico en las mujeres fue mayor que en los varones (raz\u00f3n de ventajas ajustada [ORa] 1,18, IC95% = 1,07 a 1,30), y se mantuvo estad\u00edsticamente significativa incluso tras ajustar por la edad, la raza, la etnia, el supuesto foco de infecci\u00f3n, la puntuaci\u00f3n del SOFA y el lactato (p = 0,001).\n\nAqu\u00e9llos con neumon\u00eda, en comparaci\u00f3n con otras infecciones, recibieron los antibi\u00f3ticos m\u00e1s precozmente (ORa 0,73, IC95% = 0,66 a 0,81).\n\nNo hubo asociaciones significativas entre otros focos de infecci\u00f3n y el tiempo de administraci\u00f3n de la primera dosis de antibi\u00f3tico en el an\u00e1lisis univariable ni multivariable.ConclusionesLas mujeres experimentan mayores retrasos de la administraci\u00f3n inicial de antibi\u00f3ticos en los casos de sepsis grave o shock s\u00e9ptico, incluso tras ajustar por el foco de infecci\u00f3n.\n\nLa neumon\u00eda se asocia con tiempos m\u00e1s cortos de administraci\u00f3n de antibi\u00f3tico.\n\nSe necesitan fututos estudios para investigar los factores que contribuyen a la administraci\u00f3n retrasada de antibi\u00f3tico en las mujeres.Severe sepsis and septic shock are associated with high mortality rates in both men and women.\n\nSimilar to conditions such as acute myocardial infarction,[1] women with severe sepsis and septic shock are treated less aggressively compared to men.[2] Women are less likely to receive early goal-directed therapy (EGDT)[2] and other measures of care, including central venous catheters.[3]The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) bundle, including administration of antibiotics within 3 hours, is associated with decreased sepsis mortality,[4] and for every hour in antibiotic delay, mortality increases by 7.6% for those with septic shock.[5] Our previous work showed that women are less likely to receive antibiotics within 3 hours,[6] but it was unclear whether this difference was due to an increased prevalence of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women.[7]The primary objective of this study was to investigate gender as a predictor of delays to antibiotic administration in severe sepsis or septic shock.\n\nOur secondary objective was to investigate infectious source as a contributor to gender disparities in time to antibiotic administration, if such a disparity existed.MethodsTop of pageAbstractResumenMethodsResultsDiscussionLimitationsConclusionsReferencesStudy DesignThis was a single-center, retrospective, observational cohort study.\n\nThis study was approved by the institutional review board.Study Setting and PopulationThe study included adults 18 years or older with severe sepsis or septic shock who were seen at a large (>100,000 yearly visits), urban, academic emergency department (ED) between October 2005 and March 2012.\n\nAdults admitted to the medical intensive care unit (ICU) with severe sepsis or septic shock[8] were entered into the SSC database, becoming part of the national SSC data set, and were included in the study.\n\nPatients not admitted to the ICU, and those receiving comfort measures only during the first 24 hours, were excluded.Study ProtocolData regarding arrival time, ED antibiotic administration, and infectious source were entered into the SSC database during the ICU admissions by quality assurance (QA) nurses; data entry procedures are standardized according to the national SSC.\n\nThe Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was used as a measure of illness severity.[9] Sources of infection, determined by QA nurses using the physicians' admission notes, were grouped into categories designated by the SSC:[4] pneumonia, UTI, abdominal, meningitis, skin, bone, wound, catheter, endocarditis, device, and other.\n\nVariables were created for patients with more than one documented source or with unknown sources.Two trained research assistants used standardized data abstraction forms to abstract data pertaining to study covariates from patient charts.\n\nFor data elements collected by the research assistants, interrater reliability (IRR) testing was performed.\n\nThis study was conducted using recommended methodologies including abstractor training and monitoring, abstraction forms, regular meetings, and IRR.[10]The primary outcome was time to antibiotics (the interval in minutes from ED arrival to administration of first antibiotic), consistent with the SSC quality marker.\n\nCovariates included race, ethnicity, age, SOFA score, ED lactate, and presumed source of infection.Data AnalysisMeans, medians, and proportions were used to describe data.\n\nt-tests and chi-square tests were used for bivariate analyses.\n\nLinear regression was used for multivariate analyses; no data were censored.\n\nModel covariates were chosen a priori and entered directly into models; given lack of prior literature on predictors of time to antibiotics in sepsis, potential covariates were based on scientific plausibility and study hypotheses.\n\nModels were evaluated using tests of multicollinearity, homoscedasticity, and normality of residuals.\n\nFollowing model diagnostics, the outcome variable time to antibiotics was log-transformed, and model diagnostics were repeated to ensure model fit.\n\nModel coefficients were exponentiated and reported as adjusted odds ratios (aOR).\n\nThe final model included gender, age, race, ethnicity, pneumonia, UTI, abdominal or skin source, SOFA, and lactate.\n\nOther sources of infection were not included because of their low frequencies and lack of significance with time to antibiotics.\n\nVariables indicating multiple sources or unknown sources did not improve model fit, so were not included in the final model.\n\nThe familywise Type I error rate was 0.05.\n\nAnalyses were completed using Stata 12.1.ResultsTop of pageAbstractResumenMethodsResultsDiscussionLimitationsConclusionsReferencesA total of 771 patients were included; the mean age was 66.3 years (95% confidence interval [CI] = 65.1 to 67.5 years), and 19.5% were nonwhite.\n\nBaseline characteristics including age, race, and ethnicity were similar by gender.\n\nWomen had slightly lower median SOFA scores (6, interquartile range [IQR] = 4 to 8 vs.\n\n7, IQR = 5 to 9).\n\nIRR ranged from 0.82 to 0.97.Sources of infection also differed by gender: fewer women had pneumonia (35.8%, 95% CI = 30.8% to 40.8%) than men (46.9%, 95% CI = 42.1% to 51.7%), but more women had UTIs (35.2%, 95% CI = 30.2% to 40.3%) than men (23.7%, 95% CI = 19.6% to 27.8%).\n\nMore women had multiple infectious sources (16.3%, 95% CI = 12.5% to 20.2%) than men (11.4%, 95% CI = 8.3% to 14.4%).\n\nFrequency of all other sources of infection was similar by gender.Unadjusted, the mean time to antibiotics was 31 minutes longer for women (184 minutes, 95% CI = 171 to 197) than for men (153 minutes, 95% CI = 143 to 163 minutes; p <0.001).\n\nFewer women received antibiotics with 3 hours, the SSC bundle element (women 61.3%, 95% CI = 56.2% to 66.4% vs.\n\nmen 68.7%, 95% CI = 64.3% to 73.1%; p = 0.03).For the primary study outcome, the mean time to antibiotics in women was 1.18 times longer in women than in men (95% CI = 1.07 to 1.30, p = 0.001) after adjusting for infectious source and other covariates (Table 1).\n\nAcross the entire study sample, the presence of pneumonia was associated with faster time to antibiotics (aOR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.66 to 0.81), while UTI did not have a significant association with time to antibiotics (aOR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.84 to 1.04).Table 1.\n\nMultivariate Analysis of Time to AntibioticsPredictorOR (95% CI)p-value The outcome variable, time to antibiotics, was log-transformed.\n\nCoefficients were

pageAbstractResumenMethodsResultsDiscussionLimitationsConclusionsReferencesPrevious literature has demonstrated an association between early antibiotics and lower mortality in severe sepsis and/or septic shock,[4, 5, 11] but this is the first study to investigate gender and source of infection as predictors of delays to antibiotics.\n\nWe found that women experienced delays to antibiotic administration, even after adjusting for differences in source of infection.Although our findings of longer delays to antibiotics in women are novel, these results are consistent with prior literature demonstrating that women are less likely to receive therapy consistent with standards of care in sepsis.\n\nIn a previous study, women with septic shock were less likely to receive EGDT,[2] which was defined as measurement of central venous oxygen saturation with a central line;[2] SSC bundle elements including antibiotic administration were not reported by gender.\n\nOther studies also demonstrate that women meeting EGDT criteria are less likely to receive central venous catheters.[3] Gender disparities in the treatment of patients with sepsis parallel disparities in the care of patients with other emergent conditions;[1, 12-14] in studies of patients with acute coronary syndrome, decompensated heart failure, and stroke, women are less likely to receive standard of care therapies.[1, 12-14]In our study, gender differences in infectious source did not explain the disparity in time to antibiotics.\n\nThe explanation for our finding of gender differences in time to antibiotics is not clear, suggesting the presence of unmeasured factors associated with antibiotic delays.\n\nOne could speculate that there may be gender differences in presentation: women and men may differ with regard to symptomatology, objective illness severity scores, or provider impressions of illness severity.\n\nSpecifically, women may appear less ill on presentation, leading to diagnostic and treatment delays.\n\nSlightly lower SOFA scores among women in our study suggest a difference in objective illness severity, but ICU-based scores like SOFA may not capture nuances in ED presentation that differ by gender of the patient.Data from animals suggest important sex differences in sepsis physiology, but it is unknown if these physiologic differences affect disease presentation in humans.[15] Septic female animals have more robust immune responses, have less myocardial dysfunction, and maintain better organ perfusion compared to males.[15] If human sepsis physiology is similar, women may have fewer abnormalities in vital signs and/or laboratory values on presentation and would appear less ill.\n\nIn future research, the presenting characteristics (e.g., systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria) and symptoms of septic patients should be compared by gender to determine whether women appear less ill on arrival.\n\nDevelopment of an ED-specific illness severity score could also be considered to aid in this investigation.In addition to identifying areas for future research, our study suggests implications for clinical care.\n\nGiven existing gender disparities in antibiotic delays, it is critical that providers adhere to the SSC bundle element of administering antibiotics within 3 hours.\n\nAdditionally, given our findings of delays in patients without pneumonia, sepsis educational campaigns should emphasize the importance of timely antibiotics in all infectious sources.LimitationsTop of pageAbstractResumenMethodsResultsDiscussionLimitationsConclusionsReferencesThis was an observational, retrospective, single-center study; we could not capture physicians' undocumented impressions of initial diagnoses, infectious sources, or illness severity, which may have influenced practice patterns.\n\nOur results may also be subject to misclassification bias.\n\nOther factors that may affect time to antibiotics and overall aggressiveness of care include code status, presence of respiratory distress, patients' presenting symptoms, and the gender of ED providers; we did not control for these variables.ConclusionsTop of pageAbstractResumenMethodsResultsDiscussionLimitationsConclusionsReferencesIn our study, women with severe sepsis or septic shock had longer delays to antibiotics compared to men, even after adjusting for differences in infectious source.\n\nFuture sepsis research should investigate potential gender differences in patients' presenting symptoms and providers' impressions of illness severity.\n\nAdditionally, further educational campaigns targeted toward ED providers are needed to emphasize the importance of adhering to sepsis protocols and minimizing treatment disparities.ReferencesTop of pageAbstractResumenMethodsResultsDiscussionLimitationsConclusionsReferences1Jneid H, Fonarow GC, Cannon CP, et al.\n\nSex differences in medical care and early

{"content": "AbstractPeriplasmic binding proteins (PBPs) in association with ABC transporters select and import a wide variety of ligands into bacterial cytoplasm.\n\nThey can also take up toxic molecules, as observed in the case of the phytopathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58.\n\nThis organism contains a PBP called AccA that mediates the import of the antibiotic agrocin 84, as well as the opine agrocinopine A that acts as both a nutrient and a signalling molecule for the dissemination of virulence genes through quorum-sensing.\n\nHere, we characterized the binding mode of AccA using purified agrocin 84 and synthetic agrocinopine A by X-ray crystallography at very high resolution and performed affinity measurements.\n\nStructural and affinity analyses revealed that AccA recognizes an uncommon and specific motif, a pyranose-2-phosphate moiety which is present in both imported molecules via the L-arabinopyranose moiety in agrocinopine A and the D-glucopyranose moiety in agrocin 84.\n\nWe hypothesized that AccA is a gateway allowing the import of any compound possessing a pyranose-2-phosphate motif at one end.\n\nThis was structurally and functionally confirmed by experiments using four synthetic compounds: agrocinopine 3\u2019-O-benzoate, L-arabinose-2-isopropylphosphate, L-arabinose-2-phosphate and D-glucose-2-phosphate.\n\nBy combining affinity measurements and in vivo assays, we demonstrated that both L-arabinose-2-phosphate and D-glucose-2-phosphate, which are the AccF mediated degradation products of agrocinopine A and agrocin 84 respectively, interact with the master transcriptional regulator AccR and activate the quorum-sensing signal synthesis and Ti plasmid transfer in A.\n\ntumefaciens C58.\n\nOur findings shed light on the role of agrocinopine and antibiotic agrocin 84 on quorum-sensing regulation in A.\n\ntumefaciens and reveal how the PBP AccA acts as vehicle for the importation of both molecules by means of a key-recognition motif.\n\nIt also opens future possibilities for the rational design of antibiotic and anti-virulence compounds against A.\n\ntumefaciens or other pathogens possessing similar PBPs. Author Summary We succeeded in understanding how the periplasmic protein AccA from the pathogen A.\n\ntumefaciens can bind both the plant compound agrocinopine and the antibiotic agrocin 84.\n\nWhereas agrocinopine acts as a nutrient and regulatory signal in A.\n\ntumefaciens, agrocin 84 is lethal once degraded by the enzyme AccF into a toxic moiety.\n\nWe identified the pyranose-2-phosphate-like moiety shared by these two ligands as the key recognition template for AccA.\n\nWe hypothesized that agrocin 84 would kill all agrobacteria possessing AccA and AccF and that AccA would be a gateway allowing the importation of any compound possessing a pyranose-2-phosphate motif.\n\nWe experimentally confirmed this, using synthetic derivative compounds of agrocinopine.\n\nFurthermore, using affinity and in vivo assays, we showed that arabinose-2-phosphate, resulting from the cleavage of agrocinopine by AccF, is the effector of the transcriptional repressor AccR, that controls quorum-sensing and virulence plasmid propagation.\n\nTherefore, we have identified an original and specific key molecular motif (pyranose-2-phosphate) allowing a selective passage of active compounds into the pathogen cells and acting as signals once the active compounds are cleaved into this key motif.\n\nOur work opens up new opportunities to rationally design novel antibiotics.\n\nCitation: El Sahili A, Li S-Z, Lang J, Virus C, Planamente S, Ahmar M, et al.\n\n(2015) A Pyranose-2-Phosphate Motif Is Responsible for Both Antibiotic Import and

a wide variety of extracellular compounds.\n\nPBPs recognize and bind chemical compounds in order to bring them to ABC transporters which transport them into cells [1].\n\nPBPs are also potential vehicles that facilitate the penetration of antibiotics into bacterial pathogens.\n\nTo our knowledge, the best known system that exemplifies this paradigm is the antibiotic agrocin 84, which penetrates into the cytoplasm of the bacterial pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58 by hijacking the PBP called AccA and its cognate transporter [2,3].\n\nThe antibiotic agrocin 84 is produced by the non-pathogenic bacterial strain Agrobacterium radiobacter strain K84 [2,3].\n\nSince the 1970\u2019s, A.\n\nradiobacter K84 has been used as a biocontrol agent in several countries to prevent outbreaks of the crown gall disease caused by the pathogen A.\n\ntumefaciens in a wide range of plants [4].\n\nAgrocin 84, having gained access to the A.\n\ntumefaciens C58 cytoplasm, is maturated into a toxic moiety (TM84) that inhibits agrobacterial growth [5,6].\n\nTM84 acts as a tRNA-dependent inhibitor of leucyl-tRNA synthetase that traps the enzyme in a ternary inhibition complex [7] thus preventing tRNALeu aminoacylation and thereby halting protein synthesis.\n\nAccA also plays a key-role in the importation of the characteristic plant tumour-derived compounds such as the opines agrocinopines A and B discovered in 1981 in crown gall tumour tissue [8].\n\nAgrocinopine A is composed of a sucrose linked to a L-arabinose via a phosphodiester bond.\n\nAgrocinopine B results from the cleavage of the sucrose moiety of agrocinopine A.\n\nHence agrocinopine B is composed of a fructose linked to a L-arabinose via a phosphodiester bond.\n\nThe agrocinopines A and B were purified from tumours induced by A.\n\ntumefaciens strain C58.\n\nUpon infection, A.\n\ntumefaciens genetically engineers the plant host by transferring a piece of DNA (the T-DNA) from its tumour inducing (Ti) plasmid to the nuclear genome of plants.\n\nProliferation of the transformed plant cells results in the formation of tumours colonized by the bacteria.\n\nIn plant tumours, T-DNA genes expression redirects the metabolism towards the production of several opines which are used by the pathogen as nutrients (C, N and P sources) and signals to control the quorum-sensing signal expression [9\u201311].\n\nIndeed, agrocinopines A and B play a crucial role in the A.\n\ntumefaciens C58 infection process by inducing the synthesis of the quorum-sensing signal 3-oxo-octanoylhomoserine lactone (OC8HSL) which increases aggressiveness of agrobacterium and activates the dissemination of the Ti plasmid by horizontal transfer (by conjugation) [12,13] (Fig 1).\n\nBinding of agrocinopine to the transcriptional repressor AccR, which belongs to the DeoR transcriptional factors family, is proposed to inhibit its repression [14], releasing the expression of a second transcriptional factor TraR, which binds the quorum-sensing signal OC8HSL.\n\nIn turn, the complex TraR-OC8HSL activates the expression of quorum-sensing regulated genes such as the tra and trb operons, encoding for horizontal transfer of the Ti plasmid by conjugation and the rep operon which controls the replication of the Ti plasmid.\n\nIn addition to quorum-sensing, AccR also regulates the transcription of acc (agrocinopine catabolism) genes [15].\n\nThese genes encode an agrocinopine ABC transporter system including the PBP AccA and two putative enzymes required for catabolism of agrocinopine, the phosphodiesterase AccF and the phosphatase AccG.\n\nDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Fig 1.\n\nA simplified schematic representing the agrocinopine A and agrocin 84 roles in A.\n\ntumefaciens C58.Upon infection, virulent agrobacteria transfer a small DNA fragment (T-DNA) from its virulence Ti plasmid to the nuclear genome of the plant cells leading to genetically modified plant cells and plant-tumor formation.\n\nIn plant tumor cells, the bacterial T-DNA encodes the production of opines including agrocinopine A used as nutrients and regulatory signals by agrobacteria which colonize the plant tumour tissues.\n\nAgrocinopine A is imported into the bacterial cytoplasm via the periplasmic binding protein AccA associated to a unique ABC-transporter (AccBCDE).\n\nOnce in the cytoplasm, agrocinopine A is cleaved by the enzyme AccF into sucrose and L-arabinose-2-phosphate.\n\nHowever, Agrocin 84 produced by the non-pathogenic strain A.\n\nradiobacter K84 (which colonizes the same plant environment as the A.\n\ntumefaciens C58 pathogen) uses the same import system AccA and AccBCDE for penetrating into the cytoplasm of A.\n\ntumefaciens C58.\n\nAccF cleaves agrocin 84 into D-glucose-2-phosphate and the toxic moiety named TM84 which kills pathogen cells.\n\nIn A.\n\ntumefaciens C58, agrocinopine A is proposed to interact with the transcriptional repressor AccR (dashed double lines), hence releasing acc and traR genes expression.\n\nThen, the transcriptional activator TraR interacts with quorum-sensing signals and promotes the expression of the tra, trb and rep genes which stimulate the biosynthesis of the quorum-sensing signals (traI), and amplification of copy number and conjugation of the Ti plasmid (regulation steps are indicated by double lines).\n\nIn our work, we investigated the interactions between AccA and its ligands, as well as those between AccR and L-arabinose-2-phosphate and D-glucose-2-phosphate and their consequence on quorum-sensing and Ti plasmid transfer.\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1005071.g001Agrocin 84 differs from agrocinopine A [16,17,18].\n\nIt is composed of a D-glucose-phosphoramidate linked to TM84.\n\nThe phospho-glucose moiety of agrocin 84 is required for its import into pathogenic A.\n\ntumefaciens cells [6].\n\nAgrobacterium phosphodiesterase AccF should cleave the antibiotic agrocin 84 into a D-glucose-phosphate and TM84, whereas the same enzyme cleaves agrocinopine A into L-arabinose-2-phosphate and sucrose.\n\nUsing X-ray crystallography, we investigated at the atomic level the binding mode of AccA with the antibiotic agrocin 84 and the virulence signal agrocinopine A, which are chemically different and exhibit antagonist functions.\n\nAgrocin 84 was purified from an agrobacterial strain containing a derivative of the plasmid pAgK84 that allows agrocin 84 overproduction from cells [18], while agrocinopine A was synthetized through a multistep protocol.\n\nBased on the structural analysis of AccA structures in complex with agrocinopine A or agrocin 84, we then focussed on three additional potential ligands which are analogues of agrocinopine A: agrocinopine 3\u2019-O-benzoate, L-arabinose-2-phosphate and L-arabinose-2-isopropylphosphate.\n\nTo address the structural basis for AccA specificity, the carbohydrate fragment of agrocin 84, namely D-glucose-2-phosphate was also synthetized.\n\nTo understand the regulation mode of the AccR transcriptional repressor activity and the role of the opine agrocinopine A and its AccF-mediated degradation product arabinose-2-phosphate, we combined affinity measurements and a plasmid conjugation assay using the wild-type strain and a defective strain mutant accF of A.\n\ntumefaciens C58.\n\nWe found that agrocinopine A is not the effector of AccR as previously described [14], in contrast to L-arabinose-2-phosphate and D-glucose-2-phosphate which both activate the quorum-sensing signal synthesis and the plasmid Ti conjugation.\n\nBecause L-arabinose-2-phosphate (from agrocinopine A) and D-glucose-2-phosphate (from agrocin 84) are compounds which are unique among the natural products described so far, this work reveals that A.\n\ntumefaciens evolves a pyranose-2-phosphate motif which is the key-recognition pattern by the PBP AccA for bacterial importation and by the master transcriptional regulator AccR for quorum-sensing activation and acc operon expression.\n\nResults Synthesis of agrocinopine A, its derivatives and D-glucose-2-phosphate The synthesis strategy for the production of agrocinopine A (Fig 2) allowed us to produce derivatives, which are L-arabinose-2-phosphate, L-arabinose-2-isopropylphosphate and agrocinopine-3\u2019-O-benzoate (S1 Fig).\n\nA D-glucose-2-phosphate was also synthetized (Fig 2 and S1 Fig).\n\nDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image ()

is a PBP from Class C The mature AccA expression plasmid was obtained by cloning the accA gene lacking the first twenty-nine signal sequence residues that serve for localization to bacterial periplasm.\n\nBecause AccA shares low sequence identity (around 20%) compared to PBPs with known three dimensional structures, we first solved the structure of seleniated AccA in complex with agrocinopine A at 2.65 \u00c5 resolution by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion method.\n\nA better resolution structure of this complex at 1.9 \u00c5 resolution in a different space group using the native protein was determined.\n\nThe two agrocinopine-complexed structures are very similar, displaying an average root mean square deviation (rmsd) of 0.35 \u00c5 over 489 C\u03b1 atoms.\n\nBy the molecular replacement method, we then solved the structure of AccA in complex with agrocin 84 at 2.15 \u00c5 resolution (Table 1).\n\nThe mature AccA structure is a monomer of 493 residues composed of two lobes, each formed by a central \u03b2-sheet flanked by \u03b1-helices.\n\nThe biggest lobe (lobe 1) consists of residues 29\u2013280 and 494\u2013521 and the smallest (lobe 2) comprises the residues 285\u2013489.\n\nThe two lobes are connected by a very short hinge region of 8 residues defining two short segments (Fig 3).\n\nAccA fold belongs to the cluster C within the PBP structural classification [1].\n\nOverall, the ligand bound structures are very similar (average rmsd value of 0.33 \u00c5 over 490 C\u03b1 atoms) adopting a closed conformation.\n\nThe major difference concerns the region comprising the residues 403\u2013408, which can move up to 1.7 \u00c5 to accommodate the ligand in the binding site.\n\nDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image

red.\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1005071.g003The unliganded AccA structure solved at 1.7 \u00c5 resolution adopts an open conformation.\n\nIndeed, superposition with the liganded structures results in an average rmsd of 1.5 \u00c5 for all C\u03b1 atoms and structural comparisons show that upon ligand binding, a 12\u00b0 rotation around an axis defined by the two hinge residues, Met292 and Tyr493, leads to a similar closed form of the protein.\n\nAccA binds a part of agrocinopine A and agrocin 84 ligands Both ligands are bound between the two closed lobes of AccA.\n\nWhile Agrocinopine A is fully defined in the electron density maps, the leucine-like moiety of agrocin 84 is mobile (S1 Fig).\n\nNotably, the electron density maps of agrocin 84 show a D-glucopyranose connected via its C2 carbon to the N6-phosphoramidated TM84 moiety and not a D-glucofuranose connected via a C1-linkage as previously suggested using analytical chemistry approaches that were available at the end of the 1970\u2019s [2,3,19].\n\nLater, a possible D-glucopyranose-C2 structure for the uptake moiety of agrocin 84 has been proposed [20,21].\n\nBoth bound ligands, agrocinopine A and agrocin 84, share a deeply buried pyranose (L-arabinose or D-glucose)-2-phosphate-like moiety which superimposes very well in the AccA binding site, and makes numerous and very similar protein contacts (Fig 4).\n\nThe pyranose-2-phosphate moiety lies on residues 418\u2013421 from the strand \u03b216 of lobe 2 and is surrounded by the N-terminal loop region 52\u201354 and the side chains of Tyr145, Trp178, Glu504 and Glu510 from lobe 1, that of Asn284 from the hinge region and those of Met372, Tyr375, Tyr376, Thr430, Glu434 from lobe 2.\n\nIt makes extensive protein hydrogen bonds: 8 for L-arabinose and 10 for D-glucose (Fig 4A and 4B).\n\nRemarkably, the OH1 group of the pyranose is anchored by 4 hydrogen bonds involving Asn54 and Glu510 from lobe 1, Asn284 from the hinge region and Ser419 from lobe 2.\n\nThese four side chains form a rigid template, which also maintains the lobe closure by interacting together two-by-two (S2a Fig).\n\nMoreover, in addition to their pyranose interactions, two of these major residues Asn54 and Ser419 also tightly interact with the phosphate/phosphoramidate groups.\n\nTwo more hydrogen bonds involving the side chains of two tyrosines 375 and 376 retain the phosphate/phosphoramidate oxygens.\n\nIn contrast, the sucrose moiety of agrocinopine A and the TM84 part of agrocin 84 make only 3 and 2 polar interactions with AccA, respectively.\n\nThe sucrose moiety and TM84 occupy a different position in the binding site.\n\nDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Fig

agrocinopine A and agrocin 84: L-arabinose-2-isopropylphosphate, L-arabinose-2-phosphate and D-glucose-2-phosphate at 2.1, 2.3 and 1.75 \u00c5 resolution respectively (Table 1).\n\nL-arabinose relatives and D-glucose-2-phosphate are well defined in the electron density maps (S1 Fig).\n\nThe L-arabinose-2-isopropylphosphate and L-arabinose-2-phosphate alone or within agrocinopine A make the same protein interactions and superimpose well (Fig 4C and 4E).\n\nA similar observation can be made for the bound D-glucose-2-phosphate (Fig 4D and 4E).\n\nTo summarize, AccA binds the pyranose-2-phosphate/phosphoramidate key-template through numerous polar interactions and its selectivity for this motif was validated by the structures of AccA in complex with L-arabinopyranose-2-phosphate and D-glucopyranose-2-phosphate.\n\nBinding and assimilation of a synthetic bulky ligand containing the minimal pyranose-2-phosphate motif The synthesis process of agrocinopine A allows obtaining bulky agrocinopine A derivatives such as agrocinopine 3\u2019-O-benzoate.\n\nWe used this compound to test whether AccA could bind a synthetic ligand exhibiting the minimal pyranose-2-phosphate motif.\n\nWe therefore co-crystallized AccA with this compound.\n\nThe structure at high resolution shows a very well defined bound agrocinopine 3\u2019-O-benzoate (S1 Fig).\n\nInterestingly, while the L-arabinose-2-phosphate between bound agrocinopine 3\u2019-O-benzoate and agrocinopine A superimpose, their sucrose moieties do not occupy the same position.\n\nWhereas the benzoate group of the agrocinopine 3\u2019-O-benzoate adopts the position of the sucrose in agrocinopine, its sucrose moiety follows that of the TM84 (S2b Fig).\n\nWhen present as the sole carbon source for A.\n\ntumefaciens C58, agrocinopine 3\u2019-O-benzoate is used as nutrient by the bacteria as indicated by bacterial growth (S3 Fig).\n\nA similar behaviour is observed with L-arabinose-2-phosphate used as a sole carbon source meaning that agrocinopine 3\u2019-O-benzoate is degraded in the bacterial cytoplasm once imported by AccA and its ABC transporter.\n\nThis experiment confirmed that the transporter can uptake bulky synthetic molecules such as agrocinopine 3\u2019-O-benzoate into the cell as observed for the toxin agrocin 84, which is also a relatively large molecule.\n\nAccA exhibits a high affinity for the pyranose-2-phosphate-like motif Ligand binding to the protein AccA was investigated using tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy, a method exploiting significant conformational changes accompanying the binding.\n\nThe autofluorescence intensity enhancement correlated with the ligand concentrations between 0.3 and 20 \u03bcM and saturated above 50 \u03bcM.\n\nTitration experiments yielded apparent KD values of 1.3 \u00b1 0.17 \u03bcM, 5.88 \u00b1 1.6 \u03bcM, 2.93 \u00b1 0.66 \u03bcM, 4.79 \u00b1 0.6 \u03bcM and 2.5 \u00b1 0.5 \u03bcM with agrocinopine A, agrocinopine 3\u2019-O-benzoate, L-arabinose-2-phosphate, L-arabinose-2-isopropylphosphate and D-glucose-2-phosphate, respectively (S4 Fig and S1 Table).\n\nNo fluorescence intensity change was detected by incubating AccA with L-arabinose, D-glucose or phosphate alone.\n\nAs expected from models based on the X-ray liganded AccA structures, no autofluorescence signal changes were measured by incubating AccA with glucose-1-phosphate or glucose-6-phosphate, which both are common metabolites in all living organisms.\n\nUnexpectedly, no signal was measured with agrocin 84, likely due to the presence of the adenosine moiety of agrocin 84 which provokes a quenching signal.\n\nTherefore, we used isothermal titration microcalorimetry to assess the binding of agrocin 84 to AccA, which yielded a mean KD of 1.5 \u00b1 0.41 \u03bcM.\n\nThe mean KD values were 0.3 \u00b1 0.03 \u03bcM, 7.5 \u00b1 2.2 \u03bcM, 1.33 \u00b1 0.12 \u03bcM, 2.2 \u00b1 0.58 \u03bcM and 1.16 \u00b1 0.22 \u03bcM for agrocinopine A, agrocinopine 3\u2019-O-benzoate, L-arabinose-2-phosphate, L-arabinose-2-isopropylphosphate and D-glucose-2-phosphate respectively, consistent with the values obtained from fluorescence spectroscopy.\n\nThe isothermal titration microcalorimetry data also confirmed the 1:1 binding stoichiometry and demonstrate a negative enthalpy change upon each ligand binding (S5 Fig and S2 Table), suggesting that the binding is enthalpy driven.\n\nThe similar binding isotherms for all ligands suggest a same binding mechanism involving polar interactions, in agreement with what is observed in the complexed structures (Fig 5).\n\nNevertheless, the benzoate group of the agrocinopine 3\u2019-O-benzoate molecule appears to be responsible for an entropic effect leading to a 25-fold lower affinity of this ligand with AccA in comparison with agrocinopine A.\n\nWe could not detect any binding of L-arabinose, D-glucose, nor adenosine monophosphate in line with the results obtained by fluorimetry.\n\nDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Fig 5.\n\nComparison of microcalorimetry derived enthalpy

L-arabinose-2-isopropylphosphate, L-arabinose-2-phosphate and D-glucose-2-phosphate.\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1005071.g005 Structural comparison between AccA and other PBPs A structural comparison of AccA with all PDB entries using SSM-EBI (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/ssm) [22] indicates that the most similar overall structures are PBPs from the same cluster: the structure of Staphylococcus aureus NikA in complex with nickel and histidine (PDB: 4XKN) [23], Bacillus subtilis AppA with a bound nanopeptide (PDB: 1XOC) [24], Escherichia coli OppA with different bound tripeptides (PDB: 1JET, 3TCG, 1B46, 3TCF) [25\u201327], Escherichia coli NikA with a bound nickel and histidines (PDB: 4I8C) [28], Thermatoga maritima CBP (tmCBP) with bound cellobiose and cellopentaose (PDB: 2O7I and 3IO5) [29] and Escherichia coli DPP with a bound dipeptide (PDB: 1DPP) [30].\n\nThe values of rmsd range from 1.9 \u00c5 to 2.7 \u00c5 over 413 to 434 residues.\n\nSuperposition with other PDB-entries results in an rmsd of over 2.7 \u00c5 for less than 410 C\u03b1 atoms.\n\nTherefore, the most similar PBPs bind either oligopeptides or nickel ions or oligosaccharides.\n\nThe ligand binding site of these PBPs lies on a conserved \u03b2-strand (\u03b214 in AccA) except that of tmCBP.\n\nA particularity of AccA which is not shared by these related PBPs is the presence of the flexible loop 402\u2013414 located between the \u03b2-strands \u03b215 and \u03b216 which can accommodate agrocinopine A.\n\nThis loop corresponds to a conserved rigid helix in all similar PBPs and models superposition shows that an equivalent helix in our structure would clash with the last glucose of agrocinopine A (S6a Fig).\n\nTherefore the flexible loop 402\u2013414 in AccA seems so far unique among PBPs from cluster C.\n\nThe comparison with the oligopeptide binding proteins reveals that AccA resembles the E.\n\ncoli DPP, which can bind short oligopeptides (dipeptides) only due to the presence of a loop (residues 344\u2013350) which creates a steric hindrance and reduces the size of the ligand binding site on one side.\n\nThe position of the dipeptide ligand in DPP closely matches the position of the L-arabinose-phosphate group in AccA despite the large differences in their binding mode.\n\nInterestingly, two tryptophan side chains (W178 and W423) from each AccA lobe, which occupy equivalent positions of Met152 and Asp408 in DPP form a gate that closes the ligand binding site preventing the binding of longer substrates linked beyond the pyranose moiety on the O6 or O5 atoms (S6b Fig).\n\nStructural comparison between AccA and NikA binding sites shows that the two bound histidines in NikA overlap the L-arabinose-2-phosphate moiety in AccA with the nickel ion overlapping the oxygen atom linking the arabinose to the phosphate.\n\nHowever, the loop region 51\u201355 in AccA prevents the interaction of a histidine in the binding site of AccA.\n\nAn equivalent loop in tmCBP would restrain its ligand binding site preventing the binding of long oligosaccharides.\n\nTmCBP binds oligosaccharides ranging from two rings (cellobiose) to five (cellopentaose) in a deep groove at the domain interface.\n\nThe minimal cellobiose binding site is found at one extreme of this groove and provides extensive network of hydrogen bonds for the di-saccharide.\n\nIn contrast, the cellopentaose binding site spans the entire interface in a large cavity lacking aromatic and polar residues for the last three sugars.\n\nTherefore, tmCBP exhibits specificity only for the cellobiose moiety of the cellopentaose.\n\nAlthough the position and conformation of the binding site between tmCBP and AccA differ (S7 Fig), both PBPs select a molecule class rather than single species.\n\nL-arabinose-2-phosphate and D-glucose-2-phosphate are effectors of AccR In the A.\n\ntumefaciens C58 cytoplasm, the enzyme AccF releases the L-arabinose-2-phosphate and D-glucose-2-phosphate from agrocinopine A and agrocin 84.\n\nThe question arose about their biological role in A.\n\ntumefaciens, especially in relation to regulation of the AccR/quorum-sensing pathway that controls dissemination of the Ti plasmid.\n\nWe first measured the affinity of the synthetic agrocinopine A towards purified recombinant AccR by isothermal titration microcalorimetry.\n\nAn unexpected outcome was that no affinity was detected.\n\nIn contrast, the isothermal titration microcalorimetry data show that AccR displays affinity to L-arabinose-2-phosphate and D-glucose-2-phosphate in two steps with KD values for L-arabinose-2-phosphate of KD1 = 0.11 \u00b1 0.06 (n1 = 0.4) \u03bcM for the first step and KD2 = 1.64 \u00b1 0.8 (n2 = 0.9) \u03bcM for the second step and for D-glucose-2-phosphate KD1* = 0.43 \u00b1 0.1 (n1* = 0.5) \u03bcM and KD2* = 1.64 \u00b1 0.8 \u03bcM (n2* = 0.9) (Fig 6A).\n\nThe binding stoichiometries of 2:1 (protein:ligand) in the first step and 1:1 in the second step are in line with the fact that AccR forms a dimer in solution as observed by native gel electrophoresis, suggesting that the binding of the effector to AccR may be described as following: first, a ligand binds to one molecule within the dimer before another binds to the second molecule.\n\nThese results suggest L-arabinose-2-phosphate and D-glucose-2-phosphate are the effector molecules that regulate AccR and thus they should activate quorum-sensing synthesis in A.\n\ntumefaciens cells.\n\nDownload: PPT

backgrounds were used as donor cells: C58 control, accF mutant, accF mutant complemented with p6000: accF wild type and accF mutant complemented with empty p6000).\n\nResults were obtained after 72 h of culture.\n\nSDs correspond to physical replicates.\n\nExperiments independently repeated between two and four times produce similar results.\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1005071.g006 L-arabinose-2-phosphate and D-glucose-2-phosphate activate the quorum-sensing and plasmid Ti transfer in A.\n\ntumefaciens C58 In vivo, the functions of agrocinopine A, L-arabinose-2-phosphate and D-glucose-2-phosphate as quorum-sensing effectors were examined by measuring the production of quorum-sensing molecules and efficiency of Ti plasmid transfer in conjugation between A.\n\ntumefaciens donors and the recipient A.\n\ntumefaciens C58.00 which is cured of plasmids (Fig 6B).\n\nResults indicated that all cell cultures supplemented with agrocinopine A, L-arabinose-2-phosphate and D-glucose-2-phosphate accumulate high concentrations of quorum-sensing molecules (between 50 and 100 nM) compared with mock cultures (less than 1 nM).\n\nConsistently, Ti plasmid transconjugants could also be detected in the supplemented cultures, demonstrating that agrocinopine A, L-arabinose-2-phosphate and D-glucose-2-phosphate are activators of the quorum-sensing pathway of A.\n\ntumefaciens C58.\n\nFinally, because the purified AccR exhibited affinity for L-arabinose-2-phosphate and not for agrocinopine A in vitro and because L-arabinose-2-phosphate activated quorum-sensing and plasmid Ti conjugation in vivo, we tested the hypothesis of the key-role of AccF in the maturation of agrocinopine A into L-arabinose-2-phosphate as the efficient activator of quorum-sensing signal.\n\nWe used an accF defective mutant [14].\n\nRemarkably, both accumulation of quorum-sensing molecules and Ti plasmid conjugation were abolished in the accF mutant supplemented with agrocinopine A, but restored by genetic complementation of accF demonstrating the key role of AccF in quorum-sensing signaling (Fig 6B).\n\nMoreover, quorum-sensing signals were still observed in the presence of L-arabinose-2-phosphate in both wild type and accF mutant (Fig 6B).\n\nAltogether, our findings prove that agrocinopine A needs to be degraded into L-arabinose-2-phosphate, whose interaction with the master regulator AccR induces the quorum-sensing regulation of the conjugative transfer of the Ti plasmid in A.\n\ntumefaciens C58 cells.\n\nThe pyranose-2-phosphate motif with L-arabinose-2-phosphate and D-glucose-2-phosphate are the effectors of AccR.\n\nDiscussionUnderstanding the molecular mechanism whereby toxic or beneficial compounds are imported into bacteria is a major issue, whether it aims at to understanding their biological and ecological roles or to design antibiotics.\n\nIn this work, we characterized the binding mode of agrocinopine A and agrocin 84 in the PBP AccA thanks to synthetic agrocinopine A and to agrocin 84 purified from an agrobacterial strain containing a derivative of the pAgK84 plasmid.\n\nOur structural work showed that the toxin agrocin 84, composed of a glucose moiety linked at its position 2 to TM84, is recognized through a D-glucopyranose-moiety, whereas only a furanose linked at position 1 form had been previously suggested for the structure of agrocin 84 [19].\n\nOur structural analysis of AccA ligand binding site combined with spectrofluorescence and microcalorimetry studies reveal that AccA recognizes, through numerous polar interactions, only the pyranose-2-phosphate/phosphoramidate motif of agrocinopine A, agrocin 84 and other relatives such as agrocinopine 3\u2019-O-benzoate in which the sugar is either a D-glucopyranose or a L-arabinopyranose.\n\nAccA cannot recognize a phosphate alone, nor a D-glucose, nor a L-arabinose, nor a glucose linked to a phosphate via an oxygen atom other than its O2.\n\nThe selectivity of AccA for this ligand motif was validated by the structures of AccA in complex with L-arabinose-2-phosphate and D-glucose-2-phosphate and their affinity measurement.\n\nIndeed, the KD for L-arabinose-2-phosphate is very similar to those of longer/bulkier ligands having this group, such as agrocinopine A, agrocinopine 3\u2019-O-benzoate, and L-arabinose-2-isopropyl phosphate.\n\nHence, structural and affinity data on AccA with different ligands revealed that AccA is sufficiently flexible to accommodate bulkier ligands as long as they possess the key motif on one end.\n\nMoreover, given that the extended ligand agrocin 84 is imported into the pathogen [15,31] in addition to the bulky agrocinopine 3\u2019-O-benzoate shown in this study, and since Tate and Kerr [32] have shown that a derivative compound of agrocin 84 lacking the leucine-like portion is transported into the bacteria cell, the transporter associated with AccA does not restrict the size or length of the transported molecules.\n\nThus, it should import any natural or synthetic molecules at least as bulky as the agrocin 84 and agrocinopine 3\u2019-O-benzoate that could be identified or designed for improving control of the A.\n\ntumefaciens pathogen.\n\nThe example of tmCBP [29], which also exhibits limited specificity for the first two sugar rings from its carbohydrate ligand emphasizes that PBPs have promising properties that can be exploited by both natural and synthetic antibiotics that employ a \u201cTrojan Horse\u201d strategy.\n\nArabinose-2-phosphate and glucose-2-phosphate are uncommon and original molecules in the living world due to the unusual phosphate linkage on the C2 atom of the pyranose.\n\nNo atomic structure of these molecules has been reported so far and minimal literature described the role of these molecules.\n\nThe presence of a glucose-2-phosphate has recently been reported in glycogen using NMR [33].\n\nPhosphate incorporation (glucose C2 and C3 phosphomonoesters) into glycogen results from a catalytic error of the glycogen synthase leading to insoluble glycogen-like polymer in the Lafora disease.\n\nAnother important biological role of the pyranose-2-phosphate motif concerns the quorum-sensing signal synthesis and dissemination of the Ti plasmid in agrobacteria which are under the control of the master transcriptional regulator AccR [12].\n\nOnce imported by AccA-ABC transporter into agrobacteria, agrocinopine A is degraded by the enzyme AccF into L-arabinose-2-phosphate and sucrose [15].\n\nA single study based on gel-shift assays with AccR has proposed a direct binding between agrocinopine A and AccR [14] using a mixture of agrocinopines A and B purified from tomato tumours under acidic conditions (pH 5.4).\n\nWe hypothesize that the gel shift result can be accounted for by the presence of L-arabinose-2-phosphate in the mixture.\n\nHere, we worked with synthetic agrocinopine A, L-arabinose-2-phosphate and D-glucose-2-phosphate.\n\nWe show that (1) AccR interacts with L-arabinose-2-phosphate and D-glucose-2-phosphate and not with agrocinopine A; (2) agrocinopine A, L-arabinose-2-phosphate and D-glucose-2-phosphate induce the quorum-sensing signal synthesis and Ti plasmid transfer in wild-type A.\n\ntumefaciens; (3) the quorum-sensing signal synthesis and Ti plasmid transfer are abolished in an accF mutant of pTiC58 in the presence of agrocinopine A; but are still activated in the presence of L-arabinose-2-phosphate.\n\nOur work demonstrates the key-role of AccF in the maturation of L-arabinose-2-phosphate which triggers the quorum-sensing signal and acc operon expression.\n\nIn the absence of L-arabinose-2-phosphate, the operon acc is not over-expressed leading to a weak expression of AccA thus to a weak import of agrocinopine.\n\nThis can explain why the accF mutant failed to remove detectable amounts of a mixture of agrocinopines A and B from the media [17].\n\nHowever, the same publication also showed that the accF mutant still took up agrocin 84.\n\nTherefore, from these results and from our data, AccF is not directly required for agrocinopine A transport.\n\nOur work refreshes the knowledge on the regulatory cascade of the quorum-sensing activation by the opine agrocinopine A in A.\n\ntumefaciens.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that AccF is surely involved in the maturation of agrocin 84 into the toxic moiety TM84 and D-glucose-2-phosphate.\n\nAltogether, our work supports the hypothesis that agrocin 84 hijacks the transport process of agrocinopine A via AccA and that D-glucose-2-phosphate has the same role than L-arabinose-2-phosphate in the quorum-sensing pathway of A.\n\ntumefaciens C58 pathogen and likely in the acc operon expression.\n\nAgrocinopine A is the archetype of the agrocinopine family which encompasses the agrocinopines A, B, C and D [8].\n\nAgrocinopine C is quite similar to agrocinopine A, as it is composed of a sucrose linked to a D-glucose (instead of a L-arabinose in agrocinopine A) via a phosphodiester bond.\n\nAgrocinopines B and D differ from A and C respectively, by lacking one sugar from the sucrose moiety.\n\nAgrocinopines A and B were often extracted and purified at acidic pH condition from tumours induced by A.\n\ntumefaciens strains such as C58 while the agrocinopines C and D from tumours induced by A.\n\ntumefaciens strains such as Bo542.\n\nOne study has shown that radioactive agrocinopine A was detected from C58 tumours without the presence of agrocinopine B indicating that agrocinopine A is probably the sole agrocinopine secreted in tumours [16].\n\nMoreover, agrocinopines B and D seem to be degradation products of agrocinopines A and C respectively, especially considering the latter two opines can be easily degraded either chemically by mild acid hydrolysis or enzymatically by \u03b1-glucosidase [8].\n\nIt is likely that crown gall tumours synthesize and secrete only one agrocinopine either A or C depending on its Ti-plasmid type C58 or Bo542.\n\nThe AccF by-product of agrocinopines C and D is D-glucose-2-phosphate as for agrocin 84.\n\nIn A.\n\ntumefaciens C58 and Bo542, AccA and AccR proteins are highly conserved with 75% and 83% sequence identity respectively, suggesting that they present the same function with a similar action mechanism.\n\nTherefore, L-arabinose-2-phosphate and D-glucose-2-phosphate must share a similar crucial role in all the agrocinopine pTi strains.\n\nIn A.\n\ntumefaciens strain C58, we show that quorum-sensing and plasmid Ti transfer is activated by either L-arabinose-2-phosphate or D-glucose-2-phosphate.\n\nMoreover, a similar affinity of these compounds for AccR suggests that, although synthesis of agrocinopines A and C are induced by different T-DNAs (from pTiC58 and pTiTiBo542 respectively), they play a similar role in A.\n\ntumefaciens C58.\n\nOur work provides evidence of the functional redundancy among opines of the agrocinopine family.\n\nA.\n\nradiobacter K84 employs a smart strategy when it produces agrocin 84 taking advantage of the functional and structural similarity with the opines utilized by the agrobacteria harboring the agrocinopine-family Ti plasmids.\n\nThe D-glucose-2-phosphate moiety of agrocin 84 acts as a \u2018molecular passkey\u2019, which is recognized by a large variety of pathogenic agrobacteria expressing the PBP AccA and enzyme AccF.\n\nThis feature may explain the success story of A.\n\nradiobacter K84 as a biocontrol agent against A.\n\ntumefaciens pathogens [5,6].\n\nIn conclusion, the pyranose-2-phosphate found in the L-arabinopyranose moiety in agrocinopine A (and other tested analogues and derivatives) and the D-glucopyranose moiety in agrocin 84 and agrocinopine C, is a specific motif that possesses at least two functions (transport and regulation) in agrobacteria.\n\nIn addition to being the mature signal that triggers quorum-sensing and further dissemination of virulence genes, it is the key-recognition motif of the PBP AccA presumably allowing the importation of toxic or non-toxic molecules as long as they possess it at one end.\n\nMaterials and Methods Synthesis of agrocinopine A, agrocinopine 3\u2019-O-benzoate, L-arabinose-2-phosphate and L-arabinose-2-isopropylphosphate Agrocinopine A (9) was prepared according to an adapted synthesis which was previously reported by Lindberg and Norberg [34].\n\nThe synthesis sequence was modified by using a different phosphoramidite for the coupling step, in order to keep the phosphate group protected as an ester until the latest stage of the synthesis, easing the purification of the intermediate products by simple silica gel chromatography.\n\nBenzyl 3,4-O-isopropylidene-\u03b2-L-arabinoside 1 prepared in two steps from L-arabinose [35] was phosphinylated using phosphoramidate 2 [36,37] giving the 2-substituted arabinose derivative 3 in 79% yield, which was coupled in the presence of tetrazole to the partially protected sucrose derivative 4 having only its 4-OH unprotected prepared from sucrose in 4 steps [38].\n\nThe coupling product 5 obtained in 64% yield was oxidized with t-butylhydroperoxide forming the fully protected agrocinopine 6 in 92% yield.\n\nDeprotection of the three isopropylidene groups in 60% aq.\n\nAcOH at 50\u00b0C afforded compound 7 in 53% yield.\n\nCompound 7 was further debenzylated at the anomeric position of the arabinose and on the phosphate group by catalytic hydrogenation (Pd/C, H2) leading in 83% to compound 8 having only esters as remaining protecting groups (two acetyl groups at position 3 of the glucose moiety and position 6 of the fructose moiety, and one benzoyl group at position 3 of the fructose moiety).\n\nFinal ester groups cleavage was performed using potassium carbonate in MeOH leading to agrocinopine (9) in 59% yield, for which all spectroscopic data were consistent with reported ones [39].\n\nWhen sodium methoxide was used and the reaction stopped before total consumption of intermediate products, 3\u2019-O-benzoylated agrocinopine (10) could be obtained as a mixture with agrocinopine.\n\nThe L-arabinose derivatives 14 and 18 substituted at position 2 with a phosphate or an isopropylphosphate, respectively, were prepared from the same starting phosphinylated L-arabinose 3 following a similar sequence.\n\nReaction of 3 with benzyl alcohol or isopropanol followed by oxidation, hydrolysis of the isopropylidene group and catalytic hydrogenation of the benzyl groups led to the desired L-arabinose derivatives 14 and 18 respectively (Fig 2).\n\nDetails on the procedures and spectroscopic data are given in S1 Text.\n\nSynthesis of d-glucose-2-phosphate The synthesis of glucose-2-phosphate was based on a strategy involving the selective deprotection in position 2 of perbenzylated glucose and then phosphorylation.\n\nThis synthesis was achieved starting from D-glucose in five steps.\n\nFirst, the benzyl glucoside 19 was obtained using sulfamic acid in benzyl alcohol to get the \u03b1-isomer as the major one [40].\n\nCompound 19 was then fully benzylated to obtain compound 20 which was selectively deprotected in position 2 using TIBAL.\n\nThis method described by Sina\u00ff et al.\n\ncan only debenzylate the \u03b1-isomer of 20 and led to compound 21 [41] which was then phosphorylated using the dibenzyl phosphoramidite and subsequently oxidized to compound 22.\n\nGlucose-2-phosphate was finally obtained by deprotection of benzyl groups using palladium catalyzed hydrogenation, as a mixture of \u03b1/\u03b2 isomers, the \u03b1 isomer being the major one.\n\nThe structure of glucose-2-phosphate was ascertained by mass spectrometry and 2D-NMR experiments; in particular, the position 2 of the phosphate could be confirmed by 31P-1H correlations.\n\nPurification of agrocin 84 A 3 L starter culture of A.\n\ntumefaciens NT1 (pAgK84::Tn5 A1-B5) agrocin over producing strain was inoculated into 297 L of D-glucose minimal media (modified from Richaud et al.)[18] containing kanamycin at 50 \u03bcg/mL and incubated in a large scale fermenter at 28\u00b0C for 24 h, at a low aeration rate and moderate agitation (~250 rpm).\n\nThe final culture was centrifuged at 9600 g and the supernatant containing agrocin 84 was retained.\n\nActivated Nuchar SN-20 charcoal (MeadeWestvaco Corporation) was added to the supernatant at 10 g per L and stirred at 4\u00b0C for 15 min.\n\nThe agrocin 84 bound charcoal was allowed to settle, the supernatant removed and the charcoal slurry was vacuum filtered using a large Buchner Funnel and Whatman filter paper No. 3.\n\n60 g portions of charcoal were then washed with 6 L of ddH2O at 4\u00b0C for 15 minutes and then re-filtered.\n\nAgrocin 84 was then eluted from the charcoal using 600 mL of 70% ethanol (per 60 g of charcoal) or reagent alcohol and stirring the solution overnight at 4\u00b0C.\n\nThe agrocin 84 containing ethanol was vacuum, then filtered using Whatman paper No. 3 and then Millipore White Nylon 0.20 \u03bcm filters and the filtrate collected.\n\nThe presence of agrocin 84 in samples was confirmed through use of an agrocin 84 bioassay [6].\n\nRotary evaporation was then used to remove ethanol and H2O and to concentrate the sample to a smaller volume.\n\nMethanol was added to each sample to a final concentration >70% and the resulting precipitate (containing insoluble contaminants) was removed by centrifugation of samples for 10 min at 17000 g and decanting the agrocin 84 containing supernatant.\n\nRemaining alcohol was removed by speed-vac or freeze dryer and samples stored at -80\u00b0C.Agrocin 84 was then purified using Reverse phase HPLC using a Clipeus C18 column (5 \u03bcm, 250 x 10 mm, Higgins Analytical, Inc) and the following typical conditions: buffer A (25 mM TEAA pH 7.5, in 100% H2O); buffer B (25 mM TEAA pH 7.5, in 50% H2O/ 50% acetonitrile; gradient 9\u201319% mobile phase buffer B over 33.5 min at a flow rate of 4.7 mL/min; and column temperature of 30\u00b0C.\n\nHPLC runs were monitored by UV absorbance at 264 nm and collected peaks showing activity in agrocin 84 bioassays were pooled.\n\nIf necessary, samples were re-purified by HPLC, desalted, and the agrocin 84 concentration determined using agrocin 84 extinction coefficient [32].\n\nSamples were stored at -80\u00b0C until use.\n\nCloning, expression and purification of mature AccA The mature AccA expression plasmid was obtained by cloning accA gene, without the 29 residues signal sequence, of A.\n\ntumefaciens C58 by PCR and adding a C-terminal hexahistidine tag into the plasmid pET-9aSN1 (a gift from S.\n\nCh\u00e9ruel, I2BC, University Paris Sud, Orsay, France) between the NdeI and NotI sites using 5\u2019GGATTCCATATGCAAGAACGCCGGGCGCTT3\u2019 as forward primer and 5\u2019TTTGCGGCCGCTCAATGGAGAGTGATGGTGATGGTGGCCGAAGCTGAGATTGTT3\u2019 as reverse primer.\n\nE.\n\ncoli BL21 competent cells transformed with pET9aSN1-AccA were grown in 2TY media at 37\u00b0C until OD600 of 0.6. 0.5 mM of isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to the culture for 3 h of expression.\n\nThe cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 8000 g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C and stored at -20\u00b0C.\n\nFor protein purification, the cells are resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 150 mM NaCl and 20 mM imidazole and disrupted by sonication.\n\nAfter centrifugation at 25000 g for 45 minutes, the filtered supernatant is injected on a nickel affinity column (HiTrap 5 ml, GE Healthcare).\n\nAfter a washing step of 6% of 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 150 mM NaCl and 300 mM imidazole (Buffer B), the protein is eluted with 100% of Buffer B and injected on a gel filtration Superdex 200 26/60 (GE Healthcare) using 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8 and 150 mM NaCl. The protein fractions are pooled, concentrated and stored at -80\u00b0C.\n\nExpression and purification of mature seleniated AccA The E.\n\ncoli BL21 cell transformed with the plasmid pET9aSN1-AccA were grown overnight at 28\u00b0C in M9 media supplemented with 0.4% Glucose, 2 mM MgSO4, 1 \u03bcM CaCl2, 100 mg/L of lysine, threonine, and phenylalanine, 50 mg/L of leucine, valine, isoleucine and methionine.\n\nThe pelleted cells are resuspended in fresh M9 media (same as above) with 100 mg/L of selenomethionine instead of methionine for 1 h at 37\u00b0C before inducing the expression with 0.5 mM IPTG for 5 hours.\n\nThe cells are are centrifuged at 8000 g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C and stored at -20\u00b0C.\n\nThe purification protocol was the same as described above.\n\nExpression and purification of AccR The native AccR sequence was chemically synthesized (Genscript, Piscataway, NJ) with the addition of a 6-His tag at the C terminus and of two restriction sites NdeI and NotI at the N and C terminus respectively.\n\nThe open reading frames were inserted into the pET-9aSN1 expression plasmid as for accA ORF.\n\nE.\n\ncoli C41 competent cells transformed with pET9aSN1-AccR were grown in LB media at 37\u00b0C until OD600 of 0.6. 1 mM of IPTG was added to the culture for 20 h of expression at 20\u00b0C.\n\nThe cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 8000 g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C and stored at -20\u00b0C.\n\nFor protein purification, the cells were resuspended in 20 mM Bis Tris propane pH 9, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol (Buffer C) and disrupted by sonication.\n\nAfter centrifugation at 25000 g for 45 minutes, the filtered supernatant was injected on a nickel affinity column (cOmplete His-Tag Purification Column, 5ml, Roche Lif Sciences).\n\nAfter a washing step using buffer C with 5 mM imidazole, the protein was eluted with 100% of buffer C with 100 mM imidazole before a dialysis against buffer C.\n\nThe protein was then concentrated and stored at -80\u00b0C.\n\nCrystallization and data collection of AccA Crystallization conditions for AccA at 12 mg/mL in presence and absence of ligands (between 50 \u03bcM and 10 mM) were screened using Qiagen kits (Valencia, CA, USA) with a Cartesian nanodrop robot (Genomic solutions).\n\nThe crystals were manually reproduced in hanging drops experiments by mixing equal volumes of protein solution and precipitant solution mentioned in Table 1.\n\nCrystals were transferred to a cryoprotectant solution (paraffin oil or mother liquor supplemented with 25% PEG 400) and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen.\n\nX-ray diffraction data sets were collected at 100 K on the Proxima 1 beamline (SOLEIL synchrotron, Saint-Aubin, France).\n\nData processing was performed using the XDS package [42] (Table 1).\n\nStructure determination and refinement of AccA The crystal structure of the AccA-Agrocinopine complex was determined by SAD method from selenomethionine-labelled protein and refined at 2.65 \u00c5 resolution.\n\nSolvent content analysis using CCP4 (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4) indicated the presence of one monomer in the asymmetric unit.\n\nThe positions of 17 over 18 selenium atoms were found using SHELX suite program [43].\n\nThe phases were calculated using PHASER [44] and density modification was performed by PARROT (CCP4 suite).\n\nAn iterative process of manual building in COOT combined with phase calculation using PHASER [44], where a partial model was used as input, allowed the modelling of the complete polypeptide chain.\n\nThe structure of the free-liganded AccA was solved by molecular replacement with PHASER [44] using the coordinates of lobe 1 and lobe 2 of SeMet-AccA monomer as separated search models whereas all the complexed structures were solved using the SeMet-AccA monomer as a search model.\n\nRefinement of each structure was performed with BUSTER-2.10 [45] with NCS restraints when the asymmetric unit contains more than one protein molecule.\n\nOne TLS group was assigned for each structure.\n\nInspection of the density maps and manual rebuilding were performed using COOT [46].\n\nThe three dimensional models of agrocinopine, agrocin 84 and agrocinopine 3\u2019-O-benzoate, L-arabinose-2-phosphate and L-arabinose-2-isopropylphosphate were generated using the ProDRG webserver [47].\n\nRefinement details of each structure are shown in Table 1.\n\nMolecular graphics images were generated using PyMOL (http://www.pymol.org).\n\nFluorescence titration measurements of AccA Each ligand bound to AccA was monitored by autofluorescence by excitating the protein at a wavelength of 295 nm and monitoring the quenching of fluorescence emission of tryptophans at 335 nm.\n\nAll experiments were performed at 22\u00b0C in 3 x 15 mm quartz cuvettes using Cary Eclypse spectrofluorometer (Varian) in 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and 150 mM NaCl with a fixed amount of proteins (2 \u03bcM) and increasing concentrations of ligand.\n\nEach ligand has no emission signal at 335 nm.\n\nThe data were analysed using Origin 7 software and fitted to the equation f = \u0394Fluorescencemax*abs(x)/(KD+abs(x)).\n\nIsothermal titration microcalorimetry measurements of AccA and AccR Isothermal titration microcalorimetry experiments were performed with an ITC200 isothermal titration calorimeter from MicroCal (GE Healthcare).\n\nThe experiments were carried out at 20\u00b0C for AccA and 25\u00b0C for AccR.\n\nProtein concentration in the microcalorimeter cell (0.2 mL) varied from 10 to 25 \u03bcM for AccA and 40 \u03bcM for AccR.\n\n19 injections of 2 \u03bcl of ligand solution (agrocinopine A, agrocinopine 3\u2019-O-benzoate, L-arabinose-2-isopropylphosphate and L-arabinose-2-phosphate) concentration from 150 to 240 \u03bcM for AccR and from 300 to 500 \u03bcM for AccR were performed at intervals of 180 s while stirring at 500 rpm.\n\nFor agrocin 84 experiment, we inverted the protein and ligand positions: the ligand was in the cell and the protein in the syringe.\n\nThis strategy was chosen to overcome the small amount of agrocin 84.\n\nThe experimental data were fitted to theoretical titration curves with software supplied by MicroCal (ORIGIN).\n\nThis software uses the relationship between the heat generated by each injection and \u0394H (enthalpy change in Kcal.Mol-1), Ka (the association binding constant in M-1), n (the number of binding sites), total protein concentration and free and total ligand concentrations [48].\n\nAgrocinopine 3\u2019-O-benzoate uptake assay A single colony of Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 with pTiC58 derivative pTi::Gm [49] was grown overnight at 28\u00b0C in AB media supplemented with mannitol (2 g/L) and gentamicin 25 \u03bcg.ml-1.\n\n20 ml of AB media in presence of a carbon source (agrocinopine 3\u2019-O-benzoate or L-arabinose-2-phosphate at a final concentration of 1 mM) or in absence of any carbon source and supplemented with gentamicin (25 \u03bcg.ml-1) were inoculated at an initial OD600 of 0.03 and the OD was monitored for 48 hours.\n\nA.\n\ntumefaciens strains and growth conditions The A.\n\ntumefaciens C58 control is the pTiC58 derivative pTi::Gm [49] and the defective accF mutant (A.\n\ntumefaciens C58 accF) is a kind gift from S.\n\nFarrand [14].\n\nIn complementation assay, the accF wild-type gene was cloned into p6000 [50] plasmid and electroporated into the accF mutant.\n\nRifampicin-resistant recipient strain C58.00 was derived from A.\n\ntumefaciens C58 cured of the At and Ti plasmids[51].\n\nA.\n\ntumefaciens was cultivated at 28\u00b0C in AB minimal medium containing ammonium chloride (1 g/L) and mannitol (2 g/L), or in Luria-Bertani modified medium (LBm; NaCl 5 g/L).\n\nThe antibiotics gentamycin and rifampicin were added at 25 \u03bcg/mL and 100 \u03bcg/mL, respectively.\n\nConjugation assays and quantification of OC8HSL Overnight LBm cultures of recipient (C58.00) and donor (C58 control) cells were mixed in an equal ratio (1:1).\n\n10 \u03bcl of this mix were transferred into 140 \u03bcl of AB medium supplemented with mock or 1 mM of agrocinopine A, L-arabinose-2-phosphate and glucose-2-P for static liquid cultures of 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours.\n\nSuspension dilutions of these cultures were spotted onto selective agar media to enumerate the different bacterial populations (donor, recipient and Ti plasmid transconjugants).\n\nIn parallel, to quantify OC8HSLs, aliquots of cell cultures were spotted onto TLC plates (RP-18/UV254, Macherey-Nagel) and incubated with the OC8HSL-bioindicator strain A.\n\ntumefaciens NT1(pZLR4) as previously described [52].\n\nTested samples were compared with a calibration curve obtained with pure OC8HSL (Sigma-Aldrich).\n\nAccession numbers Coordinates and structure factors have been deposited at the Protein Data Bank (PDB) under accession codes 4ZE9 (seleniated AccA with agrocinopine), 4ZE8

{"content": "AbstractBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Treatment of suspected infection is a mainstay of the daily work in the NICU.\n\nWe hypothesized that NICU antibiotic prescribing practice variation correlates with rates of proven infection, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), mortality, inborn admission, and with NICU surgical volume and average length of stay.METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study of 52 061 infants in 127 NICUs across California during 2013, we compared sample means and explored linear and nonparametric correlations, stratified by NICU level of care and lowest/highest antibiotic use rate quartiles.RESULTS: Overall antibiotic use varied 40-fold, from 2.4% to 97.1% of patient-days; median = 24.5%.\n\nAt all levels of care, it was independent of proven infection, NEC, surgical volume, or mortality.\n\nFifty percent of intermediate level NICUs were in the highest antibiotic use quartile, yet most of these units reported infection rates of zero.\n\nRegional NICUs in the highest antibiotic quartile reported inborn admission rate 218% higher (0.24 vs 0.11, P = .03), and length of stay 35% longer (90.2 days vs 66.9 days, P = .03) than regional NICUs in the lowest quartile.CONCLUSIONS: Forty-fold variation in NICU antibiotic prescribing practice across 127 NICUs with similar burdens of proven infection, NEC, surgical volume, and mortality indicates that a considerable portion of antibiotic use lacks clear warrant; in some NICUs, antibiotics are overused.\n\nAdditional study is needed to establish appropriate use ranges and elucidate the determinants and directionality of relationships between antibiotic and other resource use.antibiotic stewardshipbacterial infections and mycosesbenchmarkinghealth services researchneonatal intensive careWhat\u2019s Known on This Subject:Although treatment of infection is a mainstay of neonatal intensive care, little attention has focused on the proportion of patient antibiotic exposures validated by clinical indications that are unambiguous.What This Study Adds:Septic workups in 127 California NICUs reveal similar burdens of proven infection, yet patient antibiotic exposures in those NICUs vary 40-fold.\n\nBecause antibiotic stewardship principles dictate that antibiotic use should correlate with burden of infection, some NICUs overuse antibiotics.Wide variation in hospital resource use with little connection to patient outcomes has been reported for diverse care contexts.1 These patterns challenge the belief that directing incrementally more resources at certain health care problems necessarily produces incrementally better results.\n\nFor instance, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that as much as 50% of prescribed antibiotics are either unnecessary or suboptimally effective as prescribed.2Wide variation in outcomes has also been documented among NICUs.3,4 However, relatively little information is available connecting NICU resource use with patient outcomes.\n\nPrevention of central line associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) and other hospital-acquired infection in the NICU has been a recent target of quality improvement efforts.5\u20137 Such efforts share the broader strategic objective of reducing health care misuse (1 of 3 categories of quality problems, along with underuse and overuse).8 In 2012, more than 60% of NICUs in California reported a CLABSI rate of zero.9 It is unclear whether reported success of such infection prevention efforts affects the perceived overall burden of NICU infection and consequent use of antibiotics.\n\nAntibiotics used in circumstances where patient benefits are not clearly demonstrable would constitute overuse.10 Eliminating overuse is considered perhaps the most effective way to improve quality and reduce cost,10 yet the strategy has largely been neglected in quality improvement research and interventions.11Antibiotics are commonly used drugs in NICUs.12 If overuse is occurring in the NICU, the consequences extend beyond unwarranted resource use and increased financial cost of care.\n\nNeonatal antibiotic exposure is associated with increased risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), nosocomial infection (NI), and mortality,13\u201315 as well as with asthma later in life.16 Additionally, antimicrobial use is associated with the selection of multidrug-resistant pathogens, themselves associated with increased morbidity, mortality, cost, and length of stay.17 To explore the possibility of overuse of antibiotics for neonates, we measured NICU antibiotic practice variation and examined relationships with proven infection and other factors unambiguously connected with antibiotic exposure.MethodsCalifornia Children\u2019s Services (CCS), within the California Department of Health Care Services, confers state approval for 3 levels of NICU care: regional, community, and intermediate,18 generally corresponding to American Academy of Pediatrics levels IV, III, and II, respectively.19 CCS standards include a requirement for annual data reporting of specific variables.\n\nBeginning in 2013, CCS required NICUs to report annual antibiotic use rate (AUR).\n\nAll 116 CCS-approved NICUs submit their data to the California Perinatal Quality Care Collaborative (CPQCC),4 which prepares an annual report for each NICU and submits an aggregate data set to CCS.\n\nOf 136 NICUs in California,20 132 participate in the CPQCC.\n\nThus, the combined CPQCC/CCS data set approximates a population-based database describing NICU care and outcomes for most of the 503 738 total live births in California in 2013.21 The authors conducted the study analysis by using the CPQCC/CCS data set for calendar year 2013.\n\nThis study was approved by the Stanford University Institutional Review Board.Study Variable DefinitionsAUR is the total number of patient-days that infants were exposed to 1 or more antibacterial or antifungal agents administered intravenously or intramuscularly per 100 patient-days in the reporting NICU, expressed as a percentage.\n\nWith increasing adoption by hospitals of computerized provider order entry systems,22 NICUs were encouraged to obtain this information via a specifically designed database query, although not all units had this capability.\n\nEarly onset sepsis (EOS) rate is the percentage of infants with bacterial or fungal infection diagnosed by blood culture within 2 days of birth.\n\nCLABSI rate is the number of laboratory confirmed bloodstream infections where a central line (including an umbilical catheter) was in place for >2 days on the date of the event per 1000 central-line days.23 Inborn admission rate is the proportion of all live births at a hospital who were admitted to the NICU.\n\nNumber of surgical cases counts the number of patients undergoing a surgical procedure, excluding circumcision, cannulation/decannulation for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, placement/removal of peritoneal dialysis catheters, chest tube placement, or central line placement.\n\nNICU mortality rate is the ratio of all NICU deaths to the total number of NICU admissions.Certain CCS/CPQCC variables are restricted to infants who were 401 to 1500 g or 22 to 29 weeks\u2019 gestation at birth.\n\nNI rate is the percentage of infants with bacterial or fungal infection diagnosed by blood culture on or after 3 days after birth; fungal infection rate is the percentage of infants with a fungal infection diagnosed by blood culture on or after 3 days after birth; NEC rate is the percentage of infants diagnosed with NEC; and average length of stay (AvLOS) is the average NICU length of stay in days for patients discharged from the hospital.Statistical MethodsThe unit of observation and unit of analysis was the individual NICU.\n\nWe stratified the overall analysis by NICU levels of care and lowest/highest AUR quartiles (quartile 1/quartile 4).\n\nSample means were compared by analysis of variance; unequal variances were assessed by Bartlett\u2019s test for equal variances.\n\nP values reflect 2-tailed distributions.\n\nWe estimated the magnitude of linear correlation by Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient, unless extreme outlier values or unmet distributional assumptions warranted Spearman\u2019s rank correlation.\n\nWe used Stata 1324 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX) for all computations and graphical displays.ResultsAmong 132 CPQCC NICUs, 5 reported either missing AUR or fewer than 1 of 100 patient-days (values considered clinically implausible), and were dropped from the analysis.\n\nThe remaining 127 NICUs admitted 52 061 infants and provided care for 746 051 patient-days, of which 214 323 entailed antibiotic exposure.AUR variation is detailed in Fig 1 and Table 1.\n\nOverall, AUR varied 40-fold, from 2.4% of patient-days to 97.1% of patient-days (median = 24.5%; quartile 1 \u226417.5%, quartile 4 \u226533.5%).\n\nRegional NICU AUR varied almost sevenfold; community NICU AUR varied 12-fold; intermediate NICU AUR varied almost 31-fold; non-CCS NICU AUR varied almost fivefold.Download figure

proven infection, NEC, surgical case volume, or NICU mortality (Table 2).\n\nComparing NICUs in the lowest quartile of AUR values with NICUs in the highest quartile revealed no significant difference in burden of proven infection, NEC, surgical case volume, or mortality rate (Table 2).\n\nFigure 2 illustrates no correlation between AUR and NI among NICUs in either the lowest or highest AUR quartile (Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficient = 0.12, P = .51; and Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient = \u22120.02, P = .93, respectively).\n\nTable 3 describes the percentage of NICUs reporting specific proven infection rates of zero among providers in the lowest and highest AUR quartiles.\n\nThe proportion of high quartile AUR NICUs with specific infection rates of zero is noteworthy, especially among intermediate NICUs.View this table:View inline View popup TABLE 2 Estimated Correlations With AUR and Correlate Variable Sample Means for Quartiles 1 and 4Download figure

ZeroExamining AUR and other NICU resource use revealed no correlation between AUR and AvLOS overall, but they were positively correlated among regional-level NICUs (Fig 2; Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient = 0.78; P < .001).\n\nCompared with regional NICUs in the lowest AUR quartile, regional NICUs in the highest AUR quartile reported AvLOS 35% longer (Table 2; 90.2 days vs 66.9 days, P = .03).\n\nThere was no correlation between AUR and inborn admission rate overall, but as shown in Fig 2, they were positively correlated among both regional-level (Pearson\u2019s and Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficient = 0.61; P = .01) and intermediate-level NICUs (Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient = 0.68; P = .008).\n\nCompared with regional NICUs in the lowest AUR quartile, the inborn admission rate among regional NICUs in the highest AUR quartile was 218% higher (Table 2; 0.24 vs 0.11, P = .03).DiscussionThis study of the largest and most diverse NICU antibiotic use cohort to date (127 NICUs, 52 061 infants, and 746 051 patient-days) revealed the widest known scale of antibiotic prescribing practice variation.\n\nThis variation is independent of proven infection burden, NEC, surgical volume, or mortality rate.\n\nEven when the focus is restricted to NICUs in the highest and lowest AUR quartiles, NICUs do not differ in proven infection burden, NEC, surgical volume, or mortality rates.\n\nRather, they appear to differ only in their burden of suspected but unproven infection.\n\nVariation in antibiotic prescribing practice appears to hinge on variation in how practitioners frame, interpret, and respond to clinical situations ultimately considered unproven infection.\n\nThus, a considerable portion of the observed variation in antibiotic use appears unwarranted; in some NICUs, antibiotics are overused.Within a particular NICU level of care, the widest variation in AUR, 31-fold, occurred among intermediate level NICUs. Although these NICUs care for infants in the lower end of the severity of illness range, their median AUR was 27% greater than for community level NICUs, and the same as for regional NICUs (Table 1).\n\nIn addition, 50% of all intermediate level NICUs are in AUR quartile 4 (Table 1), yet all those NICUs reported CLABSI, NI, and fungal infection rates of zero, and 57% reported EOS of zero (Table 3).Earlier reports of antibiotic use are less comprehensive or specific, but their findings are consistent with our observations.\n\nAmong 40 children\u2019s hospitals, antibiotic-days ranged between 36.8% and 60.1% of patient-days; the variation was unexplained by patient- or hospital-level factors associated with antibiotic treatment.25 Among 29 NICUs, the point-prevalence of antibiotic use ranged between 15.2% and 85.7% of patients (median = 45.8%).12 Among 323 acute care hospitals, almost 56% of patients received antibiotics during their hospitalization.26 Finally, among 19 hospitals that reported antibiotic use to the National Healthcare Safety Network in 2012, critical care units reported a median of 937 days/1000 patient-days; ward locations, a median of 549 days/1000 patient-days; the widest variation between the 10th and 90th percentiles was threefold, among the ward locations.26 The consistency of our data with these earlier reports also mitigates concern over possible estimation errors in data reported by NICUs unable to obtain antibiotic use values via a specifically designed pharmacy database query; such NICUs instead depend upon manual abstraction of data from each medical record.\n\nAdditionally to this point, if such potential errors were inaccurate in a systematic way, the effect on data patterns would tend to make it even more unlikely to find the observed absence of correlation detailed in Table 2.Our data set accounts for almost all proven microbial infection.\n\nAlthough incidence of NI only reflects infants who were 401 to 1500 g or 22 to 29 weeks\u2019 gestation at birth, most NI occurs in this subpopulation.27 Moreover, CLABSI (a substantial subset of NI) was reported for all infants.\n\nThe overall incidence of EOS is <1/1000 live births28,29; the median inborn admission rate in our study was 113/1000 live births.\n\nThus, our findings are consistent with previous reports that revealed most NICU antibiotic use is empirical; in those studies the ultimate diagnosis is suspected infection, not proven infection.12,30 A study of antibiotic use in 2 large NICUs in California revealed almost ninefold greater use of antibiotics for unproven infection than for proven infection as measured by CLABSI.30 It should be noted, however, that our data do not enable us to estimate such practice variation as treatment duration for proven infection, perioperative prophylaxis, or contaminating/colonizing organisms.Current knowledge indicates that some clinical thresholds for initiating and/or continuing antibiotic courses for suspected infection can be raised without harm.\n\nRecent studies reveal that well-appearing term infants with negative blood cultures can have antibiotics discontinued after 48 to 72 hours even when their mothers were treated for chorioamnionitis.31\u201333 In 1 study, 24% of infants born to mothers with chorioamnionitis were treated with prolonged (>48 hours) antibiotics, but 84% of these infants received prolonged treatment solely on the basis of abnormal laboratory data.34 A new Bayesian approach to identifying EOS in infants \u226534 weeks\u2019 gestation results in empirical antibiotic treatment of a much smaller proportion of this population (only 4%) and relies on evolving objective clinical findings to guide management of all lower risk infants.33 These authors estimate that their approach could decrease antibiotic treatment in as many as 240 000 newborns nationwide.33In contrast to other reports,13\u201315 we did not find a relationship between AUR and NEC, NI, or mortality.\n\nEach of these previous studies analyzed duration of antibiotic exposure in individual patients during particular portions of the NICU hospitalization, such as the first week of life.13\u201315 Because the unit of observation and analysis in our study is the NICU, the previously reported associations could still be operating, but may be obscured by averaging exposure across all patients in an entire NICU and across entire hospital courses for all patients.\n\nThe NICU-level unit of observation and analysis also precludes adjusting outcomes for differences in baseline characteristics among patients.\n\nFor example, EOS incidence and case fatality are substantially higher in African American preterm infants compared with non-African American term infants.28 We mitigated this limitation to some degree by stratifying our analysis by NICU level, with large numbers of patients in each level.\n\nAnalytical limitations notwithstanding, the available evidence does not support the current range of practice in treating unproven infection.Case-mix adjustment is useful if study goals include a comparison among NICUs of proven infection and other factors unambiguously connected with antibiotic exposure.\n\nHowever, our primary study objective was to examine how NICU antibiotic practice variation relates with proven infection and other factors unambiguously connected with antibiotic exposure.\n\nWhether a relationship exists between those indications for antibiotic treatment and observed antibiotic use is independent of case-mix; providers generally agree that conditions like proven infection or NEC warrant antibiotic treatment (independent of the particular local burden of illness and case-mix).During the past decade, some NICUs caring for extremely low birth weight neonates have been prescribing fluconazole to prevent invasive candidiasis.35\u201337 Our data are unable to account for the practice, which is not uniform across NICUs, and where applied, would contribute to higher AURs. This practice would not be appropriate in intermediate level NICUs, where AUR variation is greatest.Although AUR was independent of clinical correlates, it sometimes was correlated with resource use.\n\nAt regional-level NICUs, higher AUR was correlated with both higher inborn admission rates and higher AvLOS.\n\nAt intermediate-level NICUs, higher AUR was correlated with higher inborn admission rates.\n\nElucidating the determinants and directionality of these relationships requires additional investigation.ConclusionsThe 40-fold variation in antibiotic use across California NICUs is unsupported by the burden of proven infection, other factors unambiguously warranting antibiotic exposure, or the peer-reviewed literature.\n\nCurrently measured rates of proven infection provide an incomplete and possibly misleading depiction of NICU care relating to imputed microbial disease.\n\nTherefore, it is reasonable for other organizations that track NICU performance to add AUR to their arrays of evaluative variables.\n\nThe goal of such benchmarking efforts should be to identify warranted ranges of AUR for NICUs providing different levels of care.38 Additional study is also needed to elucidate the determinants and directionality of relationships between AUR and other resource use.FootnotesAccepted January 29, 2015.Address correspondence to Joseph Schulman, MD, MS, Director, NICU Quality Measurement and Improvement/California Children\u2019s Services, 1515 K St, Suite 400, PO Box 997413, MS 8100, Sacramento, CA 95899-7413.\n\nE-mail: joseph.schulman{at}dhcs.ca.govDr Schulman conceptualized and designed the study, carried out the analysis, and drafted the initial manuscript;

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that >50% of all medicines are prescribed, dispensed or sold inappropriately and that half of all patients fail to take medicines correctly [3].\n\nMany countries do not implement basic policies to promote rational antibiotic use [4], and <40% of patients with infections are treated according to clinical guidelines [5].Historically, simple access to effective medicines for children in LMICs has also been challenging.\n\nHowever, following almost universal adoption of the World Health Assembly resolution WHA 60.20 \u2018Better Medicines for Children\u2019 and the subsequent launch of the WHO initiative \u2018Make medicines child size\u2019 in 2007 [6], there have been some landmark developments; these include the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines for Children (EMLc) [7] and the WHO Model Formulary (WHO MF) for Children [8].Meanwhile, despite the consensus that AMR continues to pose a global threat, national and global responses remain inadequate.\n\nFrom the child health perspective, there is a lack of national and international neonatal- and paediatric-specific AMR surveillance data, which limits the development of evidence-based guidelines and the implementation of effective prevention measures.\n\nAs there are very few new antibiotics in the late stages of the drug-development pipeline, it is critical to make best use of existing antibiotics to preserve their efficacy for as long as possible [2, 9].\n\nIn 2011, the WHO published a policy package identifying key strategies required to combat AMR (summarized in Box 1).Box 1.\n\nThe World Health Organization's policy package to combat antimicrobial resistance (adapted from Leung et al.\n\n[2])Commit to a comprehensive, financed national plan with accountability and civil society engagementStrengthen surveillance and laboratory capacityEnsure uninterrupted access to essential medicines of assured qualityRegulate and promote rational use of medicines, including use in animal husbandry, and ensure proper patient careEnhance infection prevention and controlFoster innovations and research and development for new toolsThis review summarizes the current issues relating to rational antibiotic prescribing for children in LMICs. We focus particularly on the challenges of improving antibiotic prescribing, as these remain the drugs most widely prescribed for children in this setting.Antibiotic consumption and antimicrobial resistanceTop of pageAbstractIntroductionAntibiotic consumption and antimicrobial resistanceWorld Health Organization model list of essential medicines for childrenCost, accessibility and availabilityCounterfeit medicinesEvidence-based prescribing guidelines \u2013 choice of drugAppropriate dosingDuration of therapyFormulation issuesConclusionsCompeting InterestsAppendix 1ReferencesUnderstanding the extent of antibiotic consumption is an essential starting point for strategies aimed at improving rational antibiotic use, but quantifying antibiotic consumption in LMICs is itself challenging, particularly so in children [10].\n\nMethods used for the study of antimicrobial consumption in adults, such as the ATC/DDD (Anatomical Therapeutic Classification/Defined Daily Dose) methodology [11], fail to reflect variation in paediatric dosing with bodyweight and surface area.\n\nThe existing studies of LMIC paediatric antibiotic consumption indicate the scale of the problem.\n\nMethodological differences make comparisons difficult [10].\n\nThe Antimicrobial Resistance and Prescribing in European Children (ARPEC) study recently published initial results of a large international point prevalence survey using a standardized methodology [12].\n\nOf the institutions from LMICs included (almost all of them teaching hospitals), the proportion of children prescribed antibiotics ranged from \u223c40 to 60%.\n\nThe establishment of this methodology facilitates meaningful comparisons between similar institutions and geographical regions, as well as the examination of prescribing trends.An estimated 80% of all antibiotic prescribing occurs in the community [13].\n\nSystematic data on community antibiotic prescribing in relation to children in LMICs is very sparse.\n\nA large WHO study of community prescribing highlighted significant variation in prescribing by type of healthcare facility and by geographical location.\n\nThe study encountered significant methodological and logistical challenges in collecting data, and there were no data specifically relating to children [14].\n\nFurthermore, it is also recognized that there is often a wide difference in the prescribing practice between individual countries/regions defined as LMICs. Exploration of these regional variations is beyond the scope of this review, because the available data are very limited to date.World Health Organization model list of essential medicines for

1ReferencesGiven that the availability of medicines is known to influence rational drug consumption, an important step forward has been the development of an essential medicines list (EML).\n\nThe EMLs are designed to be country specific and based on local knowledge of disease prevalence and resistance factors.\n\nHowever, since its development in 1975, the distinct needs of children had been largely ignored, until the EMLc was established in 2007.The EML aims to identify the core medicines required to cover the most common clinical needs.\n\nThere is a strong emphasis on the requirement for national policy decisions, with local ownership and implementation.\n\nIn addition, a number of guiding principles for essential drug programmes have emerged.\n\nAn explicit formulary should ensure that therapeutic choices are consistent and cost effective and should help to ensure adequate supply.\n\nThis will also enable national pricing negotiations to ensure that generic medicines are supplied at market rates.There are several issues with EMLs; for example, current evidence suggests that although 70% of WHO member nations adopt the EML concept, only 30% employ EMLs to influence reimbursements and procurements [15].\n\nAlthough evidence suggests that the use of positive formulary lists reduces prescription rates in the short term, there is a lack of data regarding their long-term effects [16].\n\nStrategies such as limiting branded products to one or two per therapeutic class have yet to be rolled out internationally.\n\nDenmark follows this policy, managing 4900 branded drugs compared with 10 000 in the UK and 23 000 in Germany [16].Cost, accessibility and availabilityTop of pageAbstractIntroductionAntibiotic consumption and antimicrobial resistanceWorld Health Organization model list of essential medicines for childrenCost, accessibility and availabilityCounterfeit medicinesEvidence-based prescribing guidelines \u2013 choice of drugAppropriate dosingDuration of therapyFormulation issuesConclusionsCompeting InterestsAppendix 1ReferencesMedicine budgets pose a high economic burden on households and health systems, accounting for 60\u201390% of household expenditure and 25\u201365% of public and private expenditure in LMICs [17].\n\nCorrect access to essential medicines would potentially save up to 10.5 million lives per year [18].\n\nThe World Trade Organization Declaration on the Trade Related Aspects of International Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement (the Doha agreement, 2001) made it possible for countries to maintain medicines at affordable levels and thus protect public health.\n\nHowever, implementing these rights is problematic due to complex tariffs and health service priorities.Up to 90% of the population in LMICs purchase medicines through out-of-pocket payments, making medicines the largest family expenditure item after food.\n\nAs a result, medicines are unaffordable for large sections of the global population [19].\n\nFinancial pressures often mean that patients may purchase medicines on a daily basis, so courses of treatment are frequently not completed or not even started at all.\n\nAdditionally, patients may store antibiotics from uncompleted courses, well beyond the expiry date, and later take them for self-diagnosed conditions or give them to family members and friends [20, 21].\n\nIn one study, 60% of Chinese parents had administered unprescribed antibiotics to their children [22].\n\nThis has important implications for antimicrobial resistance and needs to be considered by all practitioners.\n\nThe overuse of cheap, broad-spectrum antibiotics in addition to poverty and overcrowding will continue to foster antimicrobial resistance in this setting.In 2001, a resolution endorsed by WHO Member States called for the development of a standardized method for measuring medicine prices, which resulted in the launch of the WHO/Health Action International (HAI) Project on Medicine Prices and Availability [23].\n\nThe project aims to contribute to target 17 of the Millennium Development Goals: \u2018in cooperation with pharmaceutical companies, [to] provide access to affordable, essential drugs in developing countries\u2019.\n\nThe WHO/HAI methodology aimed to sample a list of 30 medicines deemed essential to treat a range of common conditions (acute and chronic) that cause substantial mortality and morbidity.\n\nOf the antibiotics included in this survey, ciprofloxacin was identified in 96% of surveyed countries and amoxicillin, ceftriaxone and cotrimoxazole in 89%.\n\nThe availability of these antibiotics varied by drug and by region.\n\nGeneric brands were poorly available in the public vs.\n\nprivate sector in low-income countries (36.1% in low-income vs.\n\n44.3% in low-middle-income countries and 76.3% in the private sector).\n\nAt the same time, the median price range for generics in the public sector was 1.1 times the international reference pricing, with African prices averaging 34\u201344% more than international reference prices [23].A study on key medicines for children included in national EMLs and treatment guidelines, which also assessed the availability of these medicines in 14 countries in central Africa, found availability to be poor [24].\n\nOnly three countries had >50% of key paediatric medicines available from central medical stores at the time of the survey.\n\nPrivate pharmacies tended to have more medicines in stock than primary healthcare clinics.\n\nAdditionally, paediatric formulations are usually more expensive than the adult equivalents, which leads to inappropriate or unsafe use of adult dosage forms [25].\n\nThis would appear to suggest that enforcing low pricing would have a beneficial effect on availability and accessibility.\n\nHowever, caution is essential as, paradoxically, reducing the price may provide a disincentive to stock low-priced generics at the point of purchase in favour of higher-priced branded products [23].For those fortunate enough financially to access antibiotics, there are further obstacles.\n\nTwo-thirds of antibiotics are sold over the counter, without written prescriptions [26].\n\nConsumers can therefore purchase antibiotics for self-diagnosed problems without any medical consultation.\n\nIn many settings, oversupply in an alternative marketplace further complicates the supply chain.\n\nEasily available medicines can artificially inflate consumer demand and, consequently, drug availability and pricing.\n\nThese factors affect the ability of healthcare facilities to maintain stocks of essential medicines and of governments to plan healthcare expenditure.\n\nWhere antibiotics are freely available, alternative (nonmedical) sellers are often the first point of call [27].\n\nThe inadequate regulation of antimicrobial supplies has important consequences for AMR, especially in LMICs where antibiotic choices are often limited.\n\nSelective pressure control strategies, such as antimicrobial cycling or the banning of monotherapy of partner drugs when used in combination therapy, depend on compliance with drug-use regulations.\n\nOveruse of antibiotics needs to be tackled through a combination of increased public awareness, training of pharmacists, legislation and adequate enforcement and monitoring of antimicrobial use and resistance.Counterfeit medicinesTop of pageAbstractIntroductionAntibiotic consumption and antimicrobial resistanceWorld Health Organization model list of essential medicines for

InterestsAppendix 1ReferencesControl of the quality of antimicrobial agents is vital for the delivery of effective therapy.\n\nLower-than-stated doses in antibiotics can result in selection of drug-resistant strains as well as therapeutic failure.\n\nCounterfeit drugs have been estimated to account for 6\u201320% of all drug sales and are most commonly antibiotics [28].\n\nIn a systematic review of the availability of counterfeit and substandard antibiotics in LMICs, the median prevalence was 28.5%, with inadequate amounts of active ingredients found in 93% of studies [29].\n\nCounterfeit medications (which also include expired drugs accessible to patients) represent only one class of substandard medications.\n\nOther products are inadvertently manufactured at substandard quality or rendered partly or totally inactive due to improper storage.\n\nMany antibiotics are heat and moisture labile and therefore liable to deteriorate in ambient tropical conditions [30].\n\nAppropriate storage is expensive and requires training; in some cases, reformulating preparations specifically for tropical countries is theoretically desirable [31].\n\nTo our knowledge, studies assessing the link between antibiotic quality and AMR have not been documented, and this issue deserves further investigation.Evidence-based prescribing guidelines \u2013 choice of drugTop of pageAbstractIntroductionAntibiotic consumption and antimicrobial resistanceWorld Health Organization model list of essential medicines for childrenCost, accessibility and availabilityCounterfeit medicinesEvidence-based prescribing guidelines \u2013 choice of drugAppropriate dosingDuration of therapyFormulation issuesConclusionsCompeting InterestsAppendix 1ReferencesThe choice of an appropriate antibacterial agent, dose and optimal duration of therapy depends on a number of variables, including the site of infection, host factors, bioavailability and palatability of the medication, local resistance patterns and, importantly, knowledge of the infectious agent.\n\nIn paediatric practice, especially in LMICs, diagnoses of infectious syndromes are often based solely upon symptoms and signs.\n\nClinical specimens to identify causative agents are not, or cannot, be practicably obtained for many infections.\n\nClinicians diagnose and treat syndromes often without knowledge of whether the causative organism is bacterial.\n\nThis makes the decision of whether to treat and with which antibiotic challenging, and probably contributes to the heterogeneity of results from clinical trials and guidelines.Standard treatment protocols have been developed to aid clinical decision making and have been shown to improve rational prescribing [32].\n\nThe WHO Drug Action Programme \u2018Guide to Good Prescribing\u2019 aims to enhance clinician education by providing a framework that promotes an evidence-based approach to prescribing [33].\n\nThe goal is to use antibiotics with proven efficacy and safety data, with consideration of the rationale behind the choice of drug, its cost and its pharmacokinetic properties.\n\nIn order to study, monitor and assess prescribing practices uniformly, the WHO has created a protocol based on recommendations by Laing et al.\n\n[4].\n\nIn a study of Gambian prescribing practices using this protocol and a global review of the literature, Risk et al.\n\n[34] highlighted extensive variations in antibiotic prescribing, with substantial overprescription of antibiotics for common childhood illnesses.\n\nTheir review highlighted the low number of drugs prescribed according to EML in Asia (38.9% in India and 56.5% in Nepal) compared with Tanzania (93.1%), Sudan (73.5%) and Gambia (95%); >50% of childhood fever encounters resulted in the prescription of antibiotics [34].The WHO Pocket Book of Hospital Care for Children offers guidance on clinical diagnosis and management of suspected severe bacterial infections in children in resource-poor settings [35].\n\nWhilst the second edition has the useful introduction of a blank front page for local antibiotic guidelines, the generic recommendations list only eight major antibiotics (Table 1) for the treatment of all severe bacterial infections in childhood.\n\nTherefore, to avoid selective pressure, these drugs must be used rationally in conjunction with appropriate guidelines.\n\nSuch protocols should ideally be evaluated in clinical trials to determine whether efficacy can be maintained while reducing the propensity for resistance.Table

prescribing medicines for children, it is important to consider not only what the most appropriate drug is, but also what are the right dose and duration of therapy [36].\n\nIn addition to accessing the medicines themselves, access to accurate, up-to-date dosing information can be difficult in LMICs. However, the advent of the WHO Model Formulary for Children mentioned above has brought significant advantages [8].\n\nThis formulary is freely accessible online and also available in paper copies.\n\nThe medicines listed match up with the second EMLc [37] and provide dosing guidance as recommended by the WHO Expert Committee on the Selection and Use of Essential Medicines [8].\n\nOther paediatric and neonatal formularies are available [38-40], some of which have specific schemes to enable access from LMICs, such as the British National Formulary for Children (BNFC), which is electronically accessible free of charge to developing nations included in the WHO's HINARI programme [38, 41].Nevertheless, ensuring reliability of access to either online or paper versions of formularies can be challenging in LMICs. Another source of information is the dosing guidance provided within the summary of product characteristics that should be enclosed in the packaging of authentic medicinal products.\n\nUnfortunately, paediatric dosing information can be absent from the summary of product characteristics, or unclear, or lacking a high-quality evidence base [42].\n\nThis relates to the fact that unlicensed and off-label use of medicines is widespread in paediatric clinical practice throughout the world [43].\n\nA variety of paediatric medicines initiatives have been developed to address these issues, but there is still much progress to be made [44].Establishing the correct weight and the right doseAssuming that access to a dosing guideline is achieved, then the recommended dose may relate to the age of the child (for age-band-based dosing), the bodyweight (weight-bands or milligram per kilogram dosing) or the body surface area.\n\nIt is not always possible to know the age or bodyweight of a child in an LMIC setting, where calibrated scales are often unavailable, so pragmatic solutions are essential, particularly in emergencies.\n\nWhen age is known, then age-based formulae can be used for dosing, including the advanced paediatric life support (APLS) and Nelson's formulae [45].\n\nIn an emergency, alternative methods may be employed, such as the Broselow Tape, which can estimate bodyweight, tracheal tube size and drug dosages based on body length [46].\n\nHowever, the accuracy of this method in different geographical populations and different age groups has been shown to vary [47, 48].\n\nA recent innovation is the \u2018Mercy TAPE\u2019, which allows improved accuracy and robustness of paediatric bodyweight estimation; the principle is based on the \u2018Mercy method\u2019 using surrogate anthropometric measures, namely mid-upper arm circumference for body habitus and humeral length for height [49].\n\nIn LMICs, broadening access to simple devices such as the Broselow or Mercy TAPE could facilitate significant improvements in the reliability of bodyweight-based dosing for children.When no dosing information for children is to hand, clinicians in LMICs may want a quick calculation to convert the adult dose to an appropriate dose for children.\n\nHistorically, different calculations have been used for this purpose, based on age, bodyweight or body surface area; the majority of calculations are not used routinely and are summarized elsewhere [50].\n\nSome have recommended using the \u2018Salisbury Rule\u2019 approach, as follows: \u2018Up to 30 kg, a child's drug dose may be (Wt \u00d7 2)% of adult dose, Over 30 kg, a child's drug dose may be (Wt + 30)% of adult dose\u2019,as this can produce results that are similar to the British National Formulary/British National Formulary for Children guidelines [50].However, the use of calculations and equations is known to increase the risk of medication errors [51].\n\nThere is also an ongoing debate regarding the best methodology to derive paediatric dosing recommendations [52].\n\nNonetheless, once the dose for the child has been decided (whether using the formulary, summary of product characteristics or dose calculation), then administering this dose will depend on access to an appropriate formulation, which again is not always possible, as discussed further below.Duration of therapyTop of pageAbstractIntroductionAntibiotic consumption and antimicrobial resistanceWorld Health Organization model list of essential medicines for childrenCost, accessibility and availabilityCounterfeit medicinesEvidence-based prescribing guidelines \u2013 choice of drugAppropriate dosingDuration of therapyFormulation issuesConclusionsCompeting InterestsAppendix 1ReferencesReducing the duration of antibiotic therapy has a number of advantages, namely increasing patient adherence, decreasing cost and minimizing antimicrobial resistance [53].\n\nSeveral studies have highlighted that shorter duration of therapy may be feasible.\n\nSchrag et al.\n\nshowed that by using a high-dose short course amoxicillin regimen, overall exposure of patients' flora to the antimicrobial agent was reduced [54].\n\nKerrison et al.\n\ndemonstrated that carriage of penicillin- and co-trimoxazole-resistant pneumococci was lower in paediatric patients receiving 90 mg kg\u22121 day\u22121 of amoxicillin for 5 days than for those receiving 40 mg kg\u22121 day\u22121 for 10 days [53].\n\nFollowing a multinational randomized controlled trial, Molyneux et al.\n\nconcluded that 5 days of treatment may be sufficient for the treatment of bacterial meningitis in LMICs. However, critics have questioned whether these results are applicable globally and call for further research into therapy duration for severe bacterial infections, including meningitis [55].BiomarkersNovel diagnostics may aid in risk stratification of serious bacterial infections and in treatment duration decisions.\n\nIn paediatrics, biomarkers such as C-reactive protein and procalcitonin are useful tools to guide commencement and cessation of antibiotic therapy [56, 57].\n\nHowever, their usefulness outside of lower respiratory tract infections has yet to be evaluated fully.\n\nThe development of near-patient testing technologies for distinguishing bacterial vs.\n\nnonbacterial infections, such as the successful use of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for malaria in reducing inappropriate antimalarial use, are a potential step in the right direction [58].\n\nHowever, although RDTs aim to improve care in malaria-endemic settings, a negative RDT increases antibiotic use as clinicians consider alternative causes of acute febrile illness [59].\n\nThe integration of new RDT technologies for bacterial infections should therefore be used in conjunction with rational decisions on the appropriateness of antibiotic therapy if a significant increase in antibiotic consumption is to be avoided.Formulation issuesTop of pageAbstractIntroductionAntibiotic consumption and antimicrobial resistanceWorld Health Organization model list of essential medicines for childrenCost, accessibility and availabilityCounterfeit medicinesEvidence-based prescribing guidelines \u2013 choice of drugAppropriate dosingDuration of therapyFormulation issuesConclusionsCompeting InterestsAppendix 1ReferencesAccess to age-appropriate formulations of medicines for children can be problematic in both developing and developed countries [60].\n\nIndeed, one of many issues raised by EMLs is the fact that most do not contain paediatric formulations, thus hindering supply and availability [61].\n\nMost medicines are initially developed for adults, and the majority are available only in solid-dosage forms [62].\n\nChildren at different stages of development may be unable to swallow solid-dosage forms, so liquid formulations are essential [63].\n\nAlthough these issues are not restricted to antibiotics alone, the importance of formulations deserves specific consideration in this context because these are the most widely prescribed class of medicines in paediatrics.\n\nAntibiotic formulation palatability has also been identified as a major determinant of prescription decision and compliance in LMICs [64].Age-appropriate formulations are frequently unavailable commercially, so are made locally as \u2018extemporaneous preparations\u2019 [65].\n\nDuncan et al.\n\nrecently evaluated the WHO MF for children to assess the following: (i) how many of the dosage forms listed were deemed suitable for children at the age and dose recommended; and (ii) whether the dosage forms listed were available in the UK.\n\nFor this analysis, an \u2018age-appropriate\u2019 dosage form was defined as [abbreviated] \u2018a dosage form for which a child of a specified age would have the natural ability to use \u2026 without the product having to be altered from its original \u201cintended\u201d presentation, prior to administration\u2019 [66].\n\nFor neonates, infants and young children, \u223c30% of the preparations (dosage form and strength) in the MF were judged as age appropriate, in contrast to 80% for older children (aged 6\u201311 years).\n\nSurprisingly, 37% of the 340 assessed medicinal products were not commercially available in the UK, which suggests that access in LMICs may also be challenging [66].To overcome formulation-related issues, many people (healthcare practitioners, parents or patients) have to resort to manipulating the dosage form provided by, for instance, tablet cutting/splitting/crushing/mixing/dissolving [67, 68].\n\nHowever, any manipulations (even simply adding the drug to food) will usually have unknown or unpredictable effects on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics [69], with associated implications for therapeutic safety and efficacy [70].\n\nEvidence is typically sparse in these situations, and there are few guidelines available [71, 72].\n\nThis is despite the fact that some extemporaneous formulations can potentially cause harm, including toxicity or therapeutic failure.\n\nAdverse events may result from inaccurate dose administration, occurring when, for example, the drug is unstable in liquid formulation (e.g. isoniazid [73]).\n\nHowever, developing age-specific formulations is expensive, so these problems persist [74].\n\nIt must also be remembered that access to multiple formulations of different strengths can potentially increase the risk of medication errors [75].\n\nIn the LMIC setting, the provision of open-access guidelines to help standardize the approach to intravenous medicines administration and extemporaneous preparations of commonly used medicines could help avoid some of these associated risks.ConclusionsTop of pageAbstractIntroductionAntibiotic consumption and antimicrobial resistanceWorld Health Organization model list of essential medicines for childrenCost, accessibility and availabilityCounterfeit medicinesEvidence-based prescribing guidelines \u2013 choice of drugAppropriate dosingDuration of therapyFormulation issuesConclusionsCompeting InterestsAppendix 1ReferencesThere is an urgent need to improve the quality of antibiotic prescribing throughout the world, particularly in resource-poor settings.\n\nIn view of the growing threat posed by AMR, this has become a global health priority.\n\nThe development of sound research methodology to capture antibiotic prescribing data from different countries has been a significant step forward, and there is now an opportunity to use global point prevalence surveys as a tool to monitor and improve prescribing internationally.\n\nFeeding back point prevalence survey results to individual institutions allows local teams to make meaningful comparisons of their prescribing practice with that of others and to identify markers of good-quality antimicrobial prescribing and strategies for improvement, including antimicrobial stewardship [76, 77].\n\nStewardship programmes in the paediatric context have been shown to reduce the length of hospital stay and also have pharmacoeconomic benefits [78], and implementation in LMICs is encouraged by the WHO [2].\n\nTo date, however, it has become clear that altering clinicians' prescribing habits takes time, and the importance of education and training is paramount.\n\nRational prescribing, AMR and stewardship must be emphasized in both undergraduate and postgraduate teaching programmes, as well as in primary and secondary care.\n\nStudies in the resource-poor setting should focus on developing cheap and simple stewardship programmes.\n\nThese initiatives are currently too costly, which makes any progress challenging in the current economic climate.\n\nWith appropriate use of open-access resources and effective dissemination of this information, the resulting changes in antimicrobial prescribing policy and practice have the potential to bring great benefits to children around the world.Competing InterestsTop of pageAbstractIntroductionAntibiotic consumption and antimicrobial resistanceWorld Health Organization model list of essential medicines for childrenCost, accessibility and availabilityCounterfeit medicinesEvidence-based prescribing guidelines \u2013 choice of drugAppropriate dosingDuration of therapyFormulation issuesConclusionsCompeting InterestsAppendix 1ReferencesAll authors have completed the Unified Competing Interest form at http://www.icmje.org/coi_disclosure.pdf (available on request from the corresponding author) and declare: no support from any organization for the submitted work;

prevent exacerbations of COPD but there is uncertainty over whether this reduces airway bacteria.\n\nThe optimum antibiotic choice remains unknown.\n\nWe conducted an exploratory trial in stable patients with COPD comparing three antibiotic regimens against placebo.\n\nMethods This was a single-centre, single-blind, randomised placebo-controlled trial.\n\nPatients aged \u226545 years with COPD, FEV1<80% predicted and chronic productive cough were randomised to receive either moxifloxacin 400 mg daily for 5 days every 4 weeks, doxycycline 100 mg/day, azithromycin 250 mg 3 times a week or one placebo tablet daily for 13 weeks.\n\nThe primary outcome was the change in total cultured bacterial load in sputum from baseline; secondary outcomes included bacterial load by 16S quantitative PCR (qPCR), sputum inflammation and antibiotic resistance.\n\nResults 99 patients were randomised; 86 completed follow-up, were able to expectorate sputum and were analysed.\n\nAfter adjustment, there was a non-significant reduction in bacterial load of 0.42 log10 cfu/mL (95% CI \u22120.08 to 0.91, p=0.10) with moxifloxacin, 0.11 (\u22120.33 to 0.55, p=0.62) with doxycycline and 0.08 (\u22120.38 to 0.54, p=0.73) with azithromycin from placebo, respectively.\n\nThere were also no significant changes in bacterial load measured by 16S qPCR or in airway inflammation.\n\nMore treatment-related adverse events occurred with moxifloxacin.\n\nOf note, mean inhibitory concentrations of cultured isolates increased by at least three times over placebo in all treatment arms.\n\nConclusions Total airway bacterial load did not decrease significantly after 3 months of antibiotic therapy.\n\nLarge increases in antibiotic resistance were seen in all treatment groups and this has important implications for future studies.\n\nTrial registration number clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01398072).\n\nCOPD Exacerbations COPD Pathology Respiratory Infection Key messages What is the key question?\n\nHow do three different antibiotics (moxifloxacin, doxycycline and azithromycin) compare in their effects on total airway bacterial load in stable COPD?\n\nWhat is the bottom line?\n\nAirway bacterial load was similar to placebo after treatment with all three antibiotics, although increases in antimicrobial resistance were noted in all treatment arms.\n\nWhy read on?\n\nThis is the first trial to directly compare the effects of different antibiotic classes on airway bacterial load in stable COPD.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section Introduction COPD exacerbations are important events associated with poorer health status,1 lung function decline2 and mortality.3 Their prevention is an important goal of COPD treatment4 ,5 which is not currently met by existing inhaled therapies.6 ,7 Exacerbation frequency is linked to airway bacterial colonisation during the stable state,8 and long-term antibiotic therapy has been proposed to prevent exacerbations.\n\nThe best evidence for this comes from the macrolide antibiotics, with both erythromycin9 and azithromycin10 shown to significantly reduce exacerbation frequency although at the expense of auditory decrements and a possible increase in cardiovascular risk.11 There is less evidence for other antibiotic classes in stable COPD, although the fluoroquinolone moxifloxacin has shown some efficacy when used in a pulsed dosing regimen,12 and with no comparative studies there are few data to inform the optimum antibiotic choice.\n\nThere are also growing concerns regarding the development of antibiotic resistance in airway bacteria.13 Although the presumptive mode of action of antibiotics is via reducing airway bacterial load, no trials to date have examined this in stable COPD.\n\nFurthermore, molecular techniques are now important tools in accurately quantifying the airway microbiome14 and may be able to detect more subtle changes with therapy than traditional culture-based methods.\n\nFor the first time, we aimed to directly compare the effects of different antibiotics on airway bacterial load in patients with stable COPD, measured both by culture and 16S quantitative PCR (qPCR).\n\nWe also examined important secondary clinical endpoints, bacterial resistance and changes in airway inflammation.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section Methods Study design This was an exploratory 13-week, single-centre, single-blind, placebo controlled, randomised controlled trial conducted at the Royal Free Hospital (London, UK).\n\nWe compared the efficacy of pulsed moxifloxacin 400 mg daily for 5 days every 4 weeks, doxycycline 100 mg daily, azithromycin 250 mg three times per week, or placebo one tablet daily, at reducing bacterial numbers in spontaneously expectorated sputum after 13 weeks of treatment.\n\nResearch ethics approval was granted by King's College Regional Ethics Committee (reference 11/LO/0932).\n\nParticipants Subjects were recruited from primary and secondary care; further details can be found in the online supplementary data.\n\nScreening and all study visits took place in the outpatient department at the Royal Free Hospital, London.\n\nSputum processing and culture, sensitivity testing and inflammatory marker analysis were conducted in the laboratories of the Centre for Respiratory Medicine and the Centre for Clinical Microbiology, Royal Free Campus, University College London.\n\nDNA extraction and 16S qPCR were conducted in the laboratories of the National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London.\n\nInclusion and exclusion criteria Stable patients aged \u226545 years with chronic bronchitis (self-reported sputum expectoration on most days when clinically stable) and spirometrically confirmed COPD (defined by FEV1<80% predicted, FEV1 to FVC ratio <0.7 and a history of smoking) were included.\n\nPatients who reported either treatment for an exacerbation or an episode of symptom worsening in the 4 weeks prior to screening, or were unable to enrol for safety reasons, were excluded.\n\nDetailed inclusion and exclusion criteria can be found in the online supplementary data.\n\nScreening and run-in period After clinical assessment, spirometry was performed in accordance with American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society guidance15 using a Vitalograph Gold Standard spirometer (Vitalograph, Maids Morton, UK).\n\nSpontaneously expectorated sputum was collected for analysis prior to randomisation.\n\nPatients also completed the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) to assess health status.\n\nPatients received diary cards and recorded any worsening of their respiratory symptoms each day for a 1-week run-in period; these have previously been shown to be a reliable index of exacerbation.16 Randomisation and masking Patients returned to the clinic 1 week after screening.\n\nThe diary cards and screening results were checked and details sought regarding any adverse events.\n\nIf the subject remained eligible and clinically stable after reassessment, and had been able to provide a sputum sample for analysis by the second visit, then internet randomisation into groups of 1:1:1:1 was performed using a computer-generated permuted block system of variable sizes (Sealed Envelope, UK).\n\nPatients remained blinded to treatment allocation.\n\nFollow-up of patients Patients were telephoned by the study doctor during weeks 5 and 9 of treatment and any adverse events or exacerbations recorded.\n\nPatients who suffered a COPD exacerbation during the trial were treated either by their treating physician or using self-administered treatment as appropriate; exacerbation treatment during the study was not standardised.\n\nTo avoid drug interactions, the study medication was temporarily stopped if the patient took other antibiotics for any reason.\n\nDetails of exacerbations were recorded on the daily diary cards and the study team notified.\n\nPatients attended the clinic at the end of 13 weeks of treatment.\n\nA further spontaneously expectorated sputum sample was collected and the SGRQ administered, diary cards collected and any exacerbations or adverse events recorded.\n\nUnused medication was collected and pill counts performed for adherence analysis.\n\nOutcome measures The primary outcome was the change in sputum bacterial load, as assessed by quantitative culture.\n\nPrespecified secondary outcomes were changes in resistance to the three tested antibiotics, changes in FEV1, adherence to therapy, health status as measured by total SGRQ scores and adverse events.\n\nFurther exploratory outcomes assessed changes in sputum bacterial load as assessed by 16S rRNA gene targeted qPCR and changes in sputum inflammation.\n\nLaboratory analysis of sputum A minimum of 0.25 g spontaneously expectorated sputum was analysed using a modification of the method described by Pye et al.17 Mean inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were established for each isolate against each of the three antibiotics by Etest (bioM\u00e9rieux UK, Basingstoke, UK) and isolates were defined as sensitive, intermediate or resistant where breakpoints were available.\n\nDNA was isolated from sputum and qPCR for 16S bacterial ribosomal RNA gene carried out using a ViiA 7 real-time PCR system (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK).\n\nSputum supernatant was batch analysed for the cytokines interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and IL-1\u03b2 using commercial high-sensitivity sandwich ELISA kits (RD Systems, Abingdon, UK).\n\nThe lower limits of detection were 0.70, 3.5 and <1.0 pg/mL, respectively.\n\nFurther detail on these methods is included in the online supplementary data.\n\nStatistical analysis Pre-existing comparative data showing the effect of antibiotics on sputum bacterial numbers using quantitative culture methods were unavailable.\n\nUsing PCR analysis, data from within our group showed that, in patients demonstrating bacterial colonisation on \u22652 occasions, mean (SD) sputum bacterial load when stable was 6.89 (1.23) log10 cfu/mL, falling to 5.01 (3.71) after antibiotic treatment at exacerbation.\n\nAssuming a correlation of 0.5 between the baseline and 3-month follow-up measurements, we calculated that 44 patients in each of the four groups would be sufficient to have a 90% chance of detecting, as significant at the 5% level, a difference between untreated (placebo) and post-treatment bacterial load of 1.88 log10 cfu/mL.\n\nAnalysis was by intention to treat.\n\nThe primary endpoint of total bacterial numbers in sputum (the sum of the bacterial load for each isolate cultured from a sample) was analysed using multiple regression after log10 transformation to assess the treatment effect for each antibiotic compared with placebo.\n\nWhere growth was below the limit of detection (6\u00d7106 cfu/mL), patients were treated as having a left-censored outcome and a parametric survival regression model was used.\n\nSpirometry, health status (SGRQ) and adherence to therapy were modelled using linear, Poisson or logistic regression as appropriate.\n\nAntibiotic resistance was modelled using a linear mixed effects model for log(MIC) to account for multiple detected isolates within each individual; a generalised mixed effects model was used to analyse resistance as a binary outcome.\n\nAll analyses were adjusted for baseline values, with multivariable analyses further adjusted for age, sex, current smoking status, FEV1% predicted and previous exacerbation history.\n\nExacerbations during the study period were defined using diary card criteria as previously reported18 as well as patient reporting to clinical health professionals or the study team, with the final decision made by consensus.\n\nA further methodological analysis compared the measurement techniques of quantitative culture and 16S qPCR using the Bland\u2013Altman method19 for all samples where both results were available.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section Results Patient characteristics at recruitment Two hundred and forty-eight patients were screened between February 2012 and May 2013; 99 were randomised, and sputum was analysed for the primary endpoint from 86.\n\nFigure 1 shows the screening, randomisation and follow-up of patients.\n\nPatient characteristics at baseline are summarised in table 1.\n\nThis cohort of patients was representative of the population with moderate\u2013severe COPD, with a male preponderance, overall mean age of 69\u00b75 years and mean FEV1 50\u00b75% predicted.\n\nView this table: In this window In a new window Table 1 Patient characteristics at baseline (mean (SD) unless stated) View larger version: In a

an analysis of bacterial load, adjusted only for baseline values, there was a mean change of \u22120\u00b732 log10 cfu/mL (95% CI \u22120.81 to 0.17, p=0.20) from placebo in the moxifloxacin arm, \u22120\u00b705 (95% CI \u22120.50 to 0.40, p=0.82) in the doxycycline arm and \u22120.17 (95% CI \u22120.62 to 0.29, p=0.47) in the azithromycin arm.\n\nThe largest change in bacterial numbers was therefore seen with moxifloxacin, equivalent to a 62% reduction, although this was not statistically significant at the 5% level.\n\nThe smallest change was seen with azithromycin.\n\nThese results are summarised in table 2.\n\nView this table: In this window In a new window Table 2 Primary and secondary outcome measures for this study A total of 395 isolates were cultured: 222 at study start and 173 after treatment.\n\nThe most common isolates were Streptococcus spp other than Streptococcus pneumoniae.\n\nFigure 2 shows the species breakdown of these isolates.\n\nView larger version: In a new window Download as PowerPoint Slide Figure 2 Species breakdown of all cultured isolates (n=395) before and after treatment.\n\nSecondary and exploratory endpoints Bacterial numbers by 16S qPCR One hundred and forty-two paired samples from 71 patients were available for this analysis.\n\nAs with quantitative culture, there were no significant changes in overall bacterial load compared with placebo in any of the antibiotic treatment arms (table 2).\n\nSputum inflammatory markers These were also measured in the subset of patients where extra paired sputum samples were available (n=71).\n\nNo significant changes were seen in any of the three measured cytokines IL-6, IL-8 and IL-1\u03b2 in any of the antibiotic treatment arms compared with placebo (table 2).\n\nBacterial resistance Two hundred and forty-three isolates from 69 patients where \u22651 isolate was cultured both pre and post treatment were tested for bacterial resistance.\n\nThere were measurable increases in the degree of antibiotic resistance of isolates in all three antibiotic arms.\n\nAfter adjusting for baseline MIC and whether the isolate was a species known to be associated with lower respiratory tract infection, moxifloxacin was associated with a factor increase in MIC of 4.82 (95% CI 1.44 to 16.19, p=0.01), doxycycline 3\u00b774 (95% CI 1.46 to 9.58, p=0.01) and azithromycin 6.23 (95% CI 1.66 to 23.35, p=0.01) for isolates cultured in sputum taken from patients assigned to those antibiotics compared with placebo.\n\nModelling the number of resistant isolates (where MIC break points were available for specific isolates to specific antibiotics), isolates from patients in the doxycycline group were more likely to be resistant to doxycycline than placebo (OR 5.77 (95% CI 1.40 to 23.74, p=0.02)).\n\nORs for the other antibiotics were also >2 but these were not statistically significant.\n\nBoxplots demonstrating the mean MIC concentrations are shown in figure 3.\n\nView larger

after 3 months of treatment.\n\nNote that MICs for all detected isolates are shown, and the number of isolates before and after treatment is not necessarily comparable.\n\nLung function There was a mean increase in FEV1 compared with placebo of 40 mL with moxifloxacin, 30 mL with doxycycline and 0 mL with azithromycin, although these changes were not significant at the 5% level, even after further adjustment (table 2).\n\nHealth status The changes in SGRQ total score are listed in table 2.\n\nAfter adjustment, the largest improvement was seen with azithromycin compared with placebo, but these changes were again not significant at the 5% level.\n\nAdherence to therapy Adherence to therapy was high in all treatment arms (mean (SD) adherence 95%,13 93%,20 96%11 and 95%9 for moxifloxacin, doxycycline, azithromycin and placebo, respectively).\n\nNo significant differences were detected between groups (table 2).\n\nExacerbations During the study, 41 patients experienced 81 distinct exacerbations (21 on moxifloxacin, 32 on doxycycline, 13 on azithromycin and 15 on placebo).\n\nThe relative risks of exacerbation are shown in table 2; there was an indication of increased exacerbations in the doxycycline group, although there was a small number of patients in the doxycycline and moxifloxacin groups who reported frequent exacerbations during the study period.\n\nFigure 4 shows the number of exacerbations by treatment group.\n\nView larger version: In a new window Download as PowerPoint Slide Figure 4 Frequency of exacerbations experienced by patients during the study period, by treatment group.\n\nAdverse events The highest number of treatment-related adverse events, 10 (40%), was reported with moxifloxacin therapy.\n\nThese were predominantly minor; therapy was withdrawn in four cases.\n\nThere were two treatment-related adverse events reported with doxycycline and one with azithromycin.\n\nThere were no treatment-related serious adverse events or suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions.\n\nFurther detail is contained in the supplementary data.\n\nComparison of airway load measurements using quantitative culture and 16S qPCR Across all samples measured by both methods, 16S qPCR detected 10-fold more bacteria than quantitative culture (excluding samples where no organisms were detected on culture, n=13) (mean (SD) 9.15 (0.79) log10 copies/mL vs 8.12 (0.71) log10 cfu/mL, p<0.001).\n\nThere was a significant correlation between the two techniques (Pearson\u2019s r=0.465, p<0.001).\n\nComparison of the measurement techniques using a Bland\u2013Altman plot showed a 3.5-log variation in the measurement differences, although there was no proportional bias across the measured range of values (figure 5).\n\nView larger version: In a

line is the mean measurement distance and dotted lines are mean\u00b11.96 (SD), that is, the values between which 95% of the measurement differences lie.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section Discussion This study, for the first time, reports on the direct comparison of 13 weeks of therapy using different antibiotic classes and different measurement techniques against the endpoint of airway bacterial load in stable COPD.\n\nMost notably, there were no significant reductions in sputum bacterial load, by culture or qPCR, with any of these three antibiotics compared with placebo.\n\nAlthough pulsed moxifloxacin demonstrated the largest fall in bacterial numbers on culture, it also had the highest incidence of associated adverse events.\n\nThere was evidence of an increase in antibiotic resistance of the cultured isolates across all treatment groups.\n\nThe primary endpoint of this study was total bacterial load, as the sum of the load of all isolates from each sample.\n\nMost of the bacteria isolated here were species classically considered to be non-pathogenic in airway disease, and this is in keeping with molecular studies of the airway microbiome which demonstrate a diverse flora dominated by firmicutes, including the Streptococcus and Rothia spp predominant here.20 While previous exacerbation studies have focused on loads of the three typical respiratory tract bacteria (S.\n\npneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae or Moraxella catarrhalis),21 ,22 which appear to increase at exacerbation,21 more recent investigation of the overall airway microbiome during naturally occurring exacerbations23 did not find an increase in total bacterial numbers.\n\nAs in the gut, the lung microbiome is commensal and plays a role in immune function;24 these non-pathogenic microorganisms are therefore also important, and changes in their numbers are likely to influence exacerbation susceptibility.\n\nWe did not find any support for our hypothesis that antibiotic therapy reduces total bacterial load in stable COPD, as well as potentially improving clinical outcome measures.\n\nAirway inflammation also did not change during treatment with any of these antibiotics and this is in keeping with previous reports9 and despite known anti-inflammatory effects of macrolide antibiotics.\n\nAs discussed below, patients in the doxycycline and moxifloxacin arms suffered more exacerbations during the study period, and given that bacterial load,21 airway inflammation25 and quality of life1 all worsen significantly at exacerbation this may have attenuated any measured reductions.\n\nIn addition, reductions in total bacterial load may only persist for a short time after quinolone therapy26 which might reduce the effectiveness of intermittent, \u2018pulsed\u2019 dosing regimens.12 Overall, however, antibiotic therapy did not appear to reduce total bacterial load after 3 months of therapy when measured either by culture or by 16S qPCR.\n\nThe reduction in exacerbation frequency observed elsewhere is therefore likely to be mediated by other mechanisms.\n\nThese may include either altering the background composition of the airway microbiome such that exacerbation susceptibility is reduced, by making the airway a less hospitable environment for the acquisition of new bacterial strains that may potentially cause exacerbation27 or alternatively by attenuating the rise in bacterial load when an exacerbation occurs rather than reducing it in the stable state.\n\nFurther research is required to investigate these possibilities.\n\nFor the first time, we have also directly analysed the measurement techniques of 16S qPCR and quantitative culture in the quantification of the airway microbiome.\n\nqPCR detected approximately 10 times as many bacteria as culture and, although significantly correlated, the wide variation between the measured values limits their direct comparability.\n\nCulture-based techniques are less sensitive than qPCR, and a normally cultivable species may not grow on culture media even when it is proved on sequencing to be the dominant organism in a sample.20 These findings therefore support the move away from culture-based to molecular techniques.\n\nAdministration of each antibiotic was associated with an MIC increase of at least three times pretreatment values compared with placebo, with a corresponding increase in clinical resistance in those organisms for which this has been defined; this supports findings from other short-term studies of antibiotic therapy.28 However, in contrast to previous studies of antibiotics in COPD focusing on resistance in specific pathogens,10 ,12 we examined all isolates cultured from sputum, and we have examined resistance in greater detail.\n\nThe information here therefore provides a much better indication of resistance in the wider airway microbiome.\n\nMacrolide resistance is rapidly inducible, highly transferrable, and increasing in prevalence commensurate with increasing macrolide prescriptions;13 resistance to quinolones and tetracyclines is also increasing globally.29 ,30 There is evidence that commensal airway streptococci act as a reservoir for S.\n\npneumoniae resistance31 and the increased resistance demonstrated here may therefore drive future antibiotic-resistant disease.\n\nThe approach of only examining resistance in those species classically thought to be pathogenic may be too narrow.\n\nThere was an indication of a higher rate of treatment-related adverse events and treatment discontinuation with moxifloxacin therapy than previously reported,12 although the types of events reported were similar.\n\nThis may be related to the higher frequency of administration here (4-weekly rather than 8-weekly) than in the previous study.\n\nBy contrast, azithromycin and doxycycline were well tolerated.\n\nHowever, there is growing evidence of increased cardiovascular risk with macrolides,11 ,32 as well as high-frequency hearing loss,10 although the size and duration of this trial were not sufficient to examine these.\n\nUntil these risks are further evaluated, advice to exercise caution in patients with cardiac risk factors33 still seems prudent.\n\nThere were no significant changes seen in the other measures of quality of life, lung function or adherence to therapy.\n\nThere was an apparent increase in exacerbations with doxycycline therapy, although this was influenced by a small number of patients, and the study period was relatively short for exacerbation detection.\n\nAlthough the placebo group had a lower self-reported exacerbation frequency than the active treatment arms, this was adjusted for in the analysis.\n\nFurthermore our composite detection of exacerbations (using diary cards and/or treatment) may have contributed to the relatively higher recorded exacerbation frequency during the study.\n\nThis study was not powered to detect changes in exacerbation frequency and this result should therefore be treated with caution.\n\nThere were a few limitations to this study.\n\nFirst, due to difficulty in double-blinding each of the three treatment regimens in a single trial, only one placebo was used and the trial was single blind.\n\nThe final sample size was 50% lower than that initially specified (99 compared with 200), and some patients were unable to spontaneously expectorate sputum at their final study visit.\n\nThis study was intentionally designed as a pilot exploratory study to assess airway bacterial changes with different antibiotics prior to a definitive study.\n\nHence, the precision of the estimates shown here cannot fully discount a reduction in airway bacterial numbers of up to 0.9 log10 cfu/mL for moxifloxacin and 0.5 log10 cfu/mL for doxycycline and azithromycin.\n\nNevertheless, we have shown that larger reductions in airway bacterial numbers (>1.0 log10, or 10-fold, cfu/mL) are unlikely.\n\nWhile the study was terminated early due to constraints with time lines, further recruitment would therefore have been unlikely to alter these conclusions.\n\nThird, as an exploratory study, this trial was not powered to detect changes in clinical endpoints and therefore further trials will be needed regarding the relative effectiveness of these antibiotics in practice.\n\nIn summary, we found no significant changes in total bacterial load with antibiotic therapy in this, the first randomised, blinded, placebo-controlled study to directly compare the use of different antibiotics in stable COPD.\n\nWe have also demonstrated an increase in the degree and rate of resistance of cultured airway bacteria following administration of these antibiotics.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section Acknowledgments The authors

Enterococci are naturally tolerant to typically bactericidal cell wall-active antibiotics, meaning that their growth is inhibited but they are not killed even when exposed to a high concentration of the drug.\n\nThe molecular reasons for this extraordinary tolerance are still incompletely understood.\n\nPrevious work showed that resistance to killing collapsed specifically in mutants affected in superoxide dismutase (Sod) activity, arguing that bactericidal antibiotic treatment led to induction of a superoxide burst.\n\nIn the present work, we show that loss of antibiotic tolerance in \u0394sodA mutants of pathogenic enterococci is dependent on the energy source present during antibiotic treatment.\n\nHexoses induce greater killing than the pentose ribose, and no killing was observed with glycerol as the energy source.\n\nThese results point to glycolytic reactions as crucial for antibiotic-mediated killing of \u0394sodA mutants.\n\nA transposon mutant library was constructed in Enterococcus faecalis \u0394sodA mutants and screened for restored tolerance of vancomycin.\n\nPartially restored tolerance was observed in mutants with transposon integrations into intergenic regions upstream of regulators implicated in arginine catabolism.\n\nIn these mutants, the arginine deiminase operon was highly upregulated.\n\nA model for the action of cell wall-active antibiotics in tolerant and nontolerant bacteria is proposed.\n\nIMPORTANCE Antibiotic tolerance is a serious clinical concern, since tolerant bacteria have considerably increased abilities to resist killing by bactericidal drugs.\n\nUsing enterococci as models for highly antibiotic-tolerant pathogens, we showed that tolerance of these bacteria is linked to their superoxide dismutase (Sod), arguing that bactericidal antibiotics induce generation of reactive oxygen species inside cells.\n\nWild-type strains are tolerant because they detoxify these deleterious molecules by the activity of Sod, whereas Sod-deficient strains are killed.\n\nThis study showed that killing depends on the energy source present during treatment and that an increase in arginine catabolism partially restored tolerance of the Sod mutants.\n\nThese results are used to propose a mode-of-action model of cell wall-active antibiotics in tolerant and nontolerant bacteria.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section INTRODUCTION Even though enterococci are considered low-virulence pathogens, treatment of enterococcal infections is often difficult and lengthy.\n\nInternational guidelines for treatment of infective enterococcal endocarditis recommend 4 to 6 weeks of administration of penicillin or ampicillin plus an aminoglycoside, with a risk of acute renal failure due to the nephrotoxicity of the latter antibiotics (1\u20133).\n\nEnterococci, which are lactic acid bacteria and part of the human commensal flora, are naturally highly tolerant to antibiotics considered to be bactericidal such as penicillins and glycopeptides (4, 5).\n\nThe mechanisms that allow these organisms to escape the lethal action of those drugs are still incompletely understood.\n\nOn the basis of previous studies, it was suggested that the tolerance might be due to alterations in bacterial autolysis, because killing of nontolerant bacteria was often accompanied by massive cell lysis (6).\n\nHowever, penicillin has been shown to kill pathogens such as Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus hirae efficiently without inducing significant lysis of the cells (7\u20139).\n\nFurthermore, suppression of autolysis in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus had no significant effect on killing by penicillin (6, 10\u201313).\n\nThese data collectively indicated that a decrease in the autolytic activity could not fully explain tolerance to bactericidal antibiotics for all drug/pathogen combinations.\n\nCharacterization of tolerant strains of Streptococcus gordonii that were obtained by cyclic exposure to penicillin at 500 times the MIC showed that two proteins belonging to the arc operon were upregulated in these derivatives (14).\n\nThe arc operon encodes activities for arginine catabolism.\n\nIn this pathway, arginine is first deiminated by arginine deiminase (ADI) encoded by arcA.\n\nThe arginine degradation pathway is therefore also called the ADI pathway.\n\nThe citrulline formed in the first reaction is then cleaved by phosphorolysis into ornithine and carbamoylphosphate catalyzed by ornithine carbamoyltransferase encoded by arcB.\n\nFinally, the high-energy compound carbamoylphosphate is degraded into CO2 and NH3 with the concomitant production of an ATP by carbamate kinase encoded by arcC (15, 16).\n\nHowever, inactivation of the arc locus in drug-tolerant strains of S.\n\ngordonii showed that increased tolerance was not a direct consequence of enhanced expression of the ADI pathway (14).\n\nAn important discovery for the understanding of the clinically problematic tolerance phenomenon was recently reported for pathogenic enterococci.\n\nTolerance of penicillin and vancomycin was abolished in superoxide dismutase (Sod)-deficient mutants of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium and could be progressively restored by increasing expression of this enzyme from an inducible plasmid (4, 5).\n\nEnterococci harbor only one Sod of the manganese type named SodA, and the enzyme catalyzes an electron transfer between two O2\u2212 molecules; the first of the two molecules is oxidized to yield oxygen, and the second is reduced to hydrogen peroxide.\n\nThe above-mentioned finding that \u0394sodA mutants of both enterococcal species are between 1,000-fold and 10000-fold more sensitive to penicillin or vancomycin killing demonstrated that SodA is essential for tolerance of bactericidal antibiotics in these pathogenic bacteria (4, 5).\n\nThe tolerance model proposed from these results foresees that bactericidal antibiotics at concentrations generally equivalent to 20\u00d7 MIC induce an increased formation of superoxide inside cells.\n\nThis is not a major problem for wild-type cells, because the O2\u2212 molecule is efficiently detoxified by SodA, resulting in tolerance.\n\nIn contrast, in SodA-deficient strains, O2\u2212 accumulates to toxic levels, leading to killing of these mutants.\n\nProduction of O2\u2212 induced by bactericidal antibiotics has been indirectly demonstrated (4).\n\nWe reasoned that superoxide should also be produced in wild-type cells under conditions of exposure to bactericidal antibiotics.\n\nHowever, the superoxide formed is dismutated to H2O2 by SodA, and the H2O2 molecule is further reduced to H2O by peroxidases.\n\nIf this cascade takes place in the wild-type cells, then the inactivation of genes encoding peroxidases should lead to an accumulation of H2O2 generated by SodA in the corresponding mutant under conditions of exposure to bactericidal but not bacteriostatic antibiotics.\n\nIn contrast to superoxide, H2O2 diffuses from the cells and can be detected (38).\n\nAs predicted, we found an accumulation of H2O2 in cultures of a strain carrying mutations in peroxidase-encoding genes under conditions of exposure to penicillin and vancomycin but not to tetracycline, which is a bacteriostatic antibiotic (4).\n\nAlthough the model is based on the well-known activity of Sod and has experimental support, issues such as how bactericidal antibiotics induce O2\u2212 production and what the targets of O2\u2212 are that lead to killing still remain to be addressed.\n\nDetailed understanding of these molecular processes might contribute to the development of better therapeutics which would clear infections by these important pathogens more rapidly.\n\nIn this work, we studied the dependence of tolerance on metabolic activity and utilization of catabolic pathways and screened a transposon mutant library for restored tolerance in a SodA-deficient strain of E.\n\nfaecalis.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains, plasmids, and growth conditions.Strains, plasmids, and oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in Table 1 and Table S1 in the supplemental material.\n\nCultures of E.\n\nfaecalis and E.\n\nfaecium strains were grown in M17 medium (23) supplemented with 0.5% (wt/vol) glucose (GM17) or in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth.\n\nFor experiments performed with specific carbon sources, we used ccM17 MOPS (morpholinepropanesulfonic acid) medium prepared as previously reported (24) (see below) and supplemented with 0.5% glucose (wt/vol) or with lactose, galactose, fructose, mannitol, ribose, or glycerol at a final concentration equimolar to that of glucose (28 mM).\n\nExperiments were performed under aerobic conditions in 100-ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 10 ml medium, and the cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0C with gentle agitation (60 rpm) on a rotary shaker.\n\nWhen indicated, catalase from bovine liver (Sigma) (900,000 U/ml) was added to the medium at a final concentration of 500 U/ml.\n\nThe growth kinetics of E.\n\nfaecalis cultures were followed both by measurement of optical density at 600 nm (OD600) with a Biophotometer (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) and by counts of viable CFU on agar plates.\n\nWhen necessary, the media were supplemented with 150 \u03bcg/ml erythromycin, 10 \u03bcg/ml chloramphenicol, or 300 \u03bcg/ml gentamicin.\n\nEscherichia coli strains were cultivated at 37\u00b0C in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth (25) with vigorous shaking (160 rpm).\n\nWhen needed, 100 \u03bcg/ml of ampicillin or 13 \u03bcg/ml of tetracycline was added to the medium.\n\nBacterial stocks were stored at \u221280\u00b0C in GM17 or LB broth supplemented with glycerol at a final concentration of 15% (vol/vol).\n\nView this table: In this window In a new window TABLE 1 Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study Susceptibility testing and time-kill curves.The MICs were determined by the Etest method.\n\nTime-kill curves were determined with exponentially growing cultures by adding vancomycin to reach a final concentration of 20 \u03bcg/ml (20\u00d7 MIC) at an OD600 of 0.5 (corresponding to \u223c4 \u00d7 108 CFU/ml).\n\nGrowth was followed by measuring OD600 at regular intervals, and CFU counts were determined after 24 h of incubation by plating 10-fold serial dilutions of the cultures on GM17 agar plates.\n\nThe number of survivors giving rise to colonies was determined after 48 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C.\n\nKilling by antibiotic was assessed as the percentage of surviving colonies relative to unchallenged cells.\n\nThe sensitization factor is defined as the ratio of survival of a parent strain to that of its derivative mutant strain.\n\nFor survival experiments in the presence of specific energy sources, cultures were grown on GM17 until an OD600 of 0.5 was reached, harvested by centrifugation, washed with 10 ml of 0.9% NaCl solution, and finally resuspended in ccM17 MOPS medium supplemented with glucose 0.5% (wt/vol) or with lactose, galactose, fructose, mannitol, ribose, or glycerol at a final concentration equimolar to that used for glucose (28 mM).\n\nImmediately after, vancomycin or penicillin was added at final concentration of 20 \u03bcg/ml.\n\nGeneral molecular methods.Molecular cloning and other standard techniques were performed as previously described (25).\n\nAntibiotics, chemicals, and enzymes were reagent grade.\n\nRestriction endonucleases and T4 ligase were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI) and used in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nPlasmids and PCR products were purified using NucleoSpin kits (Macherey-Nagel, D\u00fcnen, Germany).\n\nE.\n\ncoli and E.\n\nfaecalis competent cells were transformed by electroporation using a Gene Pulser apparatus (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Mares la Coquette, France).\n\nConstruction of insertional E.\n\nfaecalis JH2-2/pUCB30:arcA and JH2-2 \u0394sodA/pUCB30:arcA mutants.Insertional mutants with mutations in the arcA gene were constructed in E.\n\nfaecalis JH2-2 and its \u0394sodA derivative mutant using the pUCB30 suicide vector (21) (Table 1).\n\nBriefly, an internal DNA fragment of 605 bp of the arcA gene (EF_0104) was amplified by PCR with specific primers 104ForPst/104RevEco (see Table S1 in the supplemental material), digested by EcoRI and PstI, and ligated into the pUCB30 integrative vector previously treated with the same enzymes.\n\nThe ligation product was electroporated into E.\n\ncoli Top10F\u2032 cells (Table 1).\n\nThe subsequent recombinant plasmid (pUCB30:arcA) (Table 1) was transformed in E.\n\nfaecalis JH2-2 and its \u0394sodA mutant.\n\nThe generated derivative mutants (JH2-2/pUCB30:arcA and JH2-2 \u0394sodA/pUCB30:arcA mutants) (Table 1) were verified by PCR for the insertion of the pUCB30:arcA recombinant plasmid within the chromosome, leading to the inactivation of the arcA gene.\n\nConstruction of a high-density transposon mutant library using E.\n\nfaecalis \u0394sodA mutants.For transposon mutagenesis in the E.\n\nfaecalis \u0394sodA JH2-2 and OG1RF strains, we used the pZXL5 transposon delivery plasmid (GenBank accession number JQ088279) (Table 1) and a method previously described (22).\n\nBriefly, after electroporation, gentamicin-resistant transformants were grown overnight in BHI broth supplemented with 300 \u03bcg/ml gentamicin and 10 \u03bcg/ml chloramphenicol at the permissive temperature of 28\u00b0C.\n\nA 100-\u03bcl volume (approximately 108 viable cells) of this overnight culture was then inoculated into 200 ml of prewarmed BHI broth supplemented with gentamicin and 25 ng/ml nisin and grown overnight at the nonpermissive temperature of 37\u00b0C without shaking to induce transposition.\n\nSubsequently, 100 \u03bcl of this culture was transferred to 200 ml of fresh prewarmed BHI broth and grown similarly overnight without nisin.\n\nThe mutant library was stored at \u221280\u00b0C in BHI broth containing a 15% (vol/vol) final concentration of glycerol in 1-ml aliquots as mutant library stocks.\n\nRandomness and coverage of transposition were evaluated by PCR analysis and by determination of the integration site of 13 randomly selected colonies.\n\nFor the first method, genomic DNA was isolated from the library using a NucleoBond RNA/DNA 400 kit (Macherey-Nagel, D\u00fcnen, Germany) and then used as the template DNA for PCR using 14 different primers which hybridize to different chromosomal regions.\n\nEach of these primers was tested with primer LTn or RTn, corresponding to the outer primers of the transposon.\n\nIf the transposon integrates randomly, for each primer (Px) specific to a given gene (efx), the PCR carried out with primer pair Px/LTn or Px/RTn should amplify DNA fragments with different sizes, which should result in a smear on agarose gels.\n\nThis was observed (data not shown).\n\nDetermination of the integration sites of 13 randomly selected colonies was performed as described for the mapping of the integration sites in mutants with restored tolerance (see next paragraph and Fig.\n\nS1 in the supplemental material).\n\nShortly thereafter, the chromosomal DNA of the colonies was extracted and digested with HaeIII and the fragments were circularized by ligation followed by PCR analyses performed using the transposon-specific primer pair LTn/RTn. This showed that 77% of the cells harbored one copy of the transposon, that no multiple insertion sites were found, and that the transposon had integrated in different parts of the chromosome.\n\nScreening for genes involved in tolerance of vancomycin in the E.\n\nfaecalis OG1RF \u0394sodA mutant.The library of random mutants constructed in the non-vancomycin-tolerant \u0394sodA mutant of E.\n\nfaecalis OG1RF was screened for restored tolerance of vancomycin.\n\nFor this purpose, the library was grown on GM17 with gentle shaking (60 rpm) until an OD600 of 0.5 was reached, and then 20 \u03bcg/ml of vancomycin was added and the culture was incubated for 24 h at 37\u00b0C.\n\nA second treatment performed under the same conditions was applied again to enrich the number of vancomycin-tolerant mutants.\n\nFollowing this step, the culture was diluted and spread on GM17 agar medium.\n\nThe survivors were individually tested for tolerance of vancomycin.\n\nThe integration sites of the transposon of derivatives with increased tolerance of vancomycin were then analyzed.\n\nTherefore, genomic DNA was extracted for each tolerant mutant and digested with HaeIII endonuclease, generating DNA fragments containing the transposon with chromosome junctions (see Fig.\n\nS1 in the supplemental material).\n\nThe restriction fragments were then circularized using conditions favoring intramolecular reactions.\n\nThe loci in which the transposon had inserted were amplified by PCR using the transposon-specific primer pair LTn/RTn with DNA TripleMaster polymerase mix (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) under the following conditions: 94\u00b0C for 1 min followed by 32 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 18 s, 53\u00b0C for 30 s, and 68\u00b0C for 7 min.\n\nThe PCR products were purified and sequenced (Eurofins MWG Operon), and the obtained sequences were compared to the E.\n\nfaecalis OG1RF genomic sequence (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) in order to locate the insertion sites.\n\nAnalysis of fermentation products.Glucose, lactate, formate, and acetate concentrations were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).\n\nThe filtrates resulting from supernatants of 24-h cultures (25 \u03bcl) were injected in a Phenomenex PHM-monosaccharide column maintained at 65\u00b0C.\n\nThe flow rate of the mobile phase, 5 mM H2SO4, was 0.5 ml/min.\n\nA refractometer detector was used, and the signal was analyzed through the use of Jasco-Borwin software (JMBS Developments, France).\n\nThe obtained HPLC profiles from the 24-h culture filtrates were compared to the profiles from the control ccM17 MOPS media containing only the specific carbon sources.\n\nThe concentrations and the peak areas of the carbohydrate substrate and its derivative fermentation products were measured in comparison to those of their corresponding standards.\n\nRNA isolation and RT-qPCR.To comparatively analyze gene expression, we used the E.\n\nfaecalis OG1RF \u0394sodA strain and its derivative C49, C50, and C56 mutants cultivated on GM17 medium with gentle shaking.\n\nUsing a Direct-Zol RNA MiniPrep kit (ZymoRecherch), three independent samples of total RNA were isolated from each strain.\n\nFor reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), specific primers were designed (see Table S1 in the supplemental material) using the E.\n\nfaecalis OG1RF genome sequence and Primer3 software (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3/) to produce amplicons of equivalent lengths of 100 bp.\n\nTotal RNA (2 \u03bcg) was reverse transcribed with random hexamer primers and QuantiTect enzyme (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France).\n\nQuantification of gyrA (encoding the A subunit of DNA gyrase) mRNA provided an internal control.\n\nAmplification (using 5 \u03bcl of a 1:100 cDNA dilution), detection (with automatic calculation of the threshold value), and real-time analysis were performed twice for each cDNA sample using an iCycleriQ detection system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Marnes la Coquette, France).\n\nRelative mRNA levels for each gene in each sample were calculated using comparative cycle time data, as described elsewhere (26).\n\nStatistics.Differences among strains in killing by bactericidal antibiotics and gene expression were calculated using the Student t test.\n\nP values of less than 0.05 were considered to be significant.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section RESULTS Loss of tolerance of vancomycin or penicillin of Sod-deficient strains is dependent on active cell metabolism.In reports of a previous study, we showed that Sod is the basis of tolerance to bactericidal antibiotics in pathogenic enterococci (4, 5).\n\nWe proposed therefore that cell wall-active bactericidal antibiotics induced a superoxide burst responsible for the killing of \u0394sodA mutants in which the detoxification of O2\u2212 could not be performed.\n\nHowever, the exact molecular mechanisms that explain how these drugs induce O2\u2212 formation are still unknown.\n\nWe also showed that this putative production of O2\u2212 is dependent on the primary action of these antibiotics (4, 5) and that no killing occurred under anaerobic conditions (4).\n\nWe suggested that alterations of the cell wall may trigger modifications in metabolism leading to the formation of O2\u2212.\n\nThis concept predicts that, during treatment with a bactericidal antibiotic, cells should still be metabolically active.\n\nWe first studied the effect on the OD600 during treatment of the E.\n\nfaecalis JH2-2 wild-type strain and its isogenic \u0394sodA mutant when vancomycin was added at a final concentration of 20\u00d7 MIC to cultures at an OD600 of 0.5, which corresponds to the beginning of the exponential phase.\n\nAfter 24 h, those values were nearly unchanged (OD600 = \u223c0.6) and were comparable for the two strains.\n\nTo test the metabolic activity of the cells after 24 h of vancomycin treatment, we performed HPLC analyses to determine the concentrations of the substrate and final products of fermentation (Fig.\n\n1A and B).\n\nThe results showed that glucose, used as a substrate in these experiments, was completely consumed by wild-type cultures and that peaks corresponding to the end products lactate, formate, and acetate could be identified.\n\nThe result obtained with the \u0394sodA mutant was different only in that the glucose substrate was consumed only partially (44%).\n\nHowever, since the \u0394sodA mutant exhibited a decrease in survival of nearly 4 log10 whereas 80% of the wild-type cells survived (Fig.\n\n1C), it is reasonable to assume that this partial glucose consumption in the \u0394sodA mutant reflects cell death.\n\nSimilar results have been obtained after exposure to 20\u00d7 MIC of penicillin (see Fig.\n\nS2 in the supplemental material).\n\nOf note, a kinetic analysis of cell death showed that no killing by vancomycin of the JH2-2 \u0394sodA mutant was observed in the first 6 h of treatment.\n\nDuring this period, the mutant cells may have metabolic activity comparable to that of the wild-type cells (Fig.\n\n1C).\n\nWe concluded from these combined results that cells have active metabolism but do not grow in the presence of 20\u00d7 MIC of cell wall-active antibiotics.\n\nView larger version: In this window In a new window Download as PowerPoint Slide FIG 1 Metabolic activity and survival of E.\n\nfaecalis JH2-2 and the \u0394sodA mutant under conditions of vancomycin treatment.\n\nData represent the results of HPLC analysis of the remaining substrate and fermentation products after 24 h of treatment with 20 \u03bcg/ml vancomycin in ccM17 MOPS medium supplemented with 0.5% (wt/vol) glucose of the E.\n\nfaecalis JH2-2 wild-type strain (A) or its \u0394sodA mutant (B) and kinetic analysis of killing by vancomycin of the JH2-2 wild-type strain (\u25cb) and its isogenic \u0394sodA mutant (\u25b5) (C).\n\nWT, wild type.\n\nLoss of tolerance of vancomycin or penicillin of Sod-deficient strains is dependent on the energy source.From the previous observation, we hypothesized that the catabolic activity of the cells is a requirement for antibiotic-induced killing and is the basis of the O2\u2212 production.\n\nIf true, incubation of the \u0394sodA mutant with vancomycin in the absence of a carbohydrate would not result in a decrease in viability.\n\nAs shown in Fig.\n\n2A, this was indeed the case.\n\nWe then reasoned that if the reactions that are the basis of the O2\u2212 formation are linked with particular catabolic pathways, incubation with different substrates during treatment metabolized by different catabolic routes should modify killing of the \u0394sodA mutant.\n\nEnterococci harbor the three major pathways of carbohydrate catabolism (16), the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (glycolysis) pathway, the Entner-Doudoroff (KDPG [2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate]) pathway, and the pentose phosphate pathway (Fig.\n\n2B).\n\nThe first two pathways are restricted to hexoses, whereas the pentose pathway ferments hexoses and pentoses.\n\nFirst, we tested different hexoses such as glucose, galactose, and fructose but also mannitol and the disaccharide lactose (data not shown).\n\nWith all these substrates, significant vancomycin killing of the \u0394sodA mutant (which was 600-fold to 3,000-fold more sensitive than the parent strain) was observed (Fig.\n\n2A).\n\nUsing glucose as the substrate, similar results have been obtained with penicillin (see Fig.\n\nS2 in the supplemental material).\n\nNotably, for the majority of these sugars, the Sod-deficient strain exhibited a slight growth retardation compared to the wild-type parent (see Fig.\n\nS3).\n\nThis difference in growth was most pronounced in the case of the use of galactose as the substrate, probably due to the generation of H2O2 when E.\n\nfaecalis was aerobically grown on this energy source (24).\n\nWe then tried the hexose gluconate as the energy source, but neither the JH2-2 strain nor the OG1RF strain grew significantly on this substrate.\n\nA similar result has been published for E.\n\nfaecalis strain V583 (27).\n\nIn the next step, we tested the pentose ribose, which is metabolized through the pentose phosphate pathway (Fig.\n\n2B).\n\nOn this sugar as well, growth of the \u0394sodA mutant was slightly slower than that of the JH2-2 wild-type strain (see Fig.\n\nS3).\n\nInterestingly, compared to the hexose results, the use of ribose as a substrate during the antibiotic treatment reduced killing of the \u0394sodA mutant by 2 orders of magnitude (Fig.\n\n2A).\n\nComparable results have been obtained with the E.\n\nfaecium Com12 wild-type strain and its \u0394sodA mutant using glucose and ribose as substrates (see Fig.\n\nS4).\n\nView larger version: In this window In a new window Download as PowerPoint Slide FIG 2 Bactericidal activity is dependent on the energy source in the E.\n\nfaecalis JH2-2 \u0394sodA mutant.\n\n(A) Ratio of relative survival rates of the E.\n\nfaecalis \u0394sodA mutant and the E.\n\nfaecalis JH2-2 wild-type strain after 24 h of exposure to 20 \u03bcg/ml of vancomycin in ccM17 MOPS medium supplemented with glucose, galactose, fructose, ribose, or glycerol.\n\nIn the case of glucose, ribose, and glycerol supplementation, similar results in the presence of 20 \u03bcg/ml of penicillin have been obtained (see Fig.\n\nS2 in the supplemental material).\n\nMean values of the results of at least three different experiments are represented with error bars indicating standard deviations.\n\n(B) Integration of the results determined as described for panel A into the metabolic network of E.\n\nfaecalis.\n\nMetabolites are color-coded according to the degree of killing by vancomycin.\n\nThe following metabolic intermediates are shown: glucose-6-phosphate (Glu-6-P), glucose-1-phosphate (Glu-1-P), fructose-6-phosphate (Fru-6-P), fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (Fru-1,6-P2), galactose-1-phosphate (Gal-1-P), galactose-6-phosphate (Gal-6-P), tagatose-1-6 bisphosphate (Tag-1,6-P2), glycerol-3-phosphate (G-3-P), dihydroxyacetone (DHA), dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHA-P), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GA-3-P), 1,3-bisphospho-glycerate (G-1,3-P2), 3-phospho-glycerate (3-P-G), 2-phospho-glycerate (2-P-G), phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), ribulose-5-phosphate (Rbu-5-P), ribose-5-phosphate (Rib-5-P), xylulose-5-phosphate (Xyl-5-P), erythrose-4-phosphate (Ery-4-P), sedoheptulose-7-phosphate (Sed-7-P), 6-phospho-gluconate (6-P-Gln), and 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate (KDPG).\n\nAn interesting substrate to study in the context of this work was glycerol, since the complex catabolism of this sugar alcohol has been recently intensively studied in E.\n\nfaecalis (28, 29).\n\nE.\n\nfaecalis harbors two pathways of glycerol catabolism, the glycerol kinase (GlpK) pathway and the dihydroxyacetone kinase (DHAK) pathway.\n\nBoth pathways finally generate dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), which then enters the lower part of the glycolysis pathway shown in Fig.\n\n2B.\n\nThe GlpK pathway starts with phosphorylation of glycerol to glycerol-3-phosphate (G-3-P) by the use of glycerol kinase.\n\nThe G-3-P formed is then oxidized by G-3-P oxidase to DHAP, leading to the generation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).\n\nThe route that proceeds via the DHAK pathway starts with the oxidation of the substrate by glycerol dehydrogenase to dihydroxyacetone (DHA) with the concomitant generation of an NADH.\n\nThe DHA is then phosphorylated to DHAP by DHAK.\n\nWe showed recently that glycerol is metabolized simultaneously by the two pathways in the E.\n\nfaecalis JH2-2 strain (28).\n\nWhen glycerol was used as a substrate during the antibiotic treatment of the \u0394sodA mutant, killing by vancomycin was abolished (Fig.\n\n2A).\n\nAs mentioned above, the metabolism of glycerol via the GlpK pathway leads to the generation of H2O2, and we demonstrated that transient accumulation of this peroxide occurred during growth of the E.\n\nfaecalis JH2-2 wild-type strain, leading to a growth inhibition which became even more pronounced in mutants affected in peroxidases (24).\n\nSince \u0394sodA mutants are more sensitive to externally added H2O2 (18, 30, 31), the possibility that the growth on glycerol of the JH2-2 \u0394sodA mutant was affected by the intracellular generation of H2O2 during catabolism of this substrate could not be excluded, and we tested this experimentally.\n\nWhile the wild-type JH2-2 strain grew to a final OD600 of 3.5, the isogenic \u0394sodA mutant entered stationary phase early after start of growth and reached a final OD600 of only 0.4 (see Fig.\n\nS3 in the supplemental material).\n\nThis growth inhibition was due to the accumulation of H2O2, since addition of active (but not of heat-inactivated) bovine catalase to the growth medium lifted this growth inhibition (see Fig.\n\nS3).\n\nIn the presence of catalase, growth of the \u0394sodA mutant was comparable to that of the JH2-2 parental strain.\n\nSince we showed that the \u0394sodA mutant was not killed by vancomycin in the absence of a carbohydrate source (which led to a lack of growth [see above]), the possibility could not be excluded that the survival of this strain when glycerol was used as a carbon source during antibiotic treatment was due to the absence of significant growth and hence to reduced metabolic activity of the \u0394sodA mutant.\n\nTherefore, we analyzed killing of the \u0394sodA mutant with the concomitant presence of glycerol and catalase during vancomycin treatment.\n\nWe showed previously that addition of catalase did not affect killing of the JH2-2 \u0394sodA mutant in M17 medium containing 0.5% glucose (4).\n\nHowever, in the presence of glycerol and catalase, the SodA-deficient strain survived vancomycin exposure as well as the isogenic parent strain did (Fig.\n\n2A).\n\nTherefore, the slow-growth phenotype was not the reason for the absence of killing when glycerol was used as the energy source.\n\nThe combined results presented above strongly suggest that the degree of loss of tolerance of the \u0394sodA mutant is dependent on the catabolic pathway used to metabolize an energy source.\n\nThe presence of substrates during the antibiotic treatment upon entering glycolysis led to high-level killing of the \u0394sodA mutant.\n\nKilling was significantly reduced when ribose, which is metabolized through the pentose phosphate pathway, was the substrate.\n\nFinally, in the presence of glycerol, the \u0394sodA mutant was as tolerant as the wild type to exposure to 20\u00d7 MIC of vancomycin.\n\nSince glycerol enters the lower part of the glycolysis pathway and no killing of the \u0394sodA mutant was observed with this substrate, we speculated that reactions present in the upper part of the glycolysis pathway should be responsible for the increased killing of the \u0394sodA mutant.\n\nThis would also explain the residual killing observed with ribose as the substrate.\n\nThe pentose phosphate pathway is connected to the upper and lower parts of the glycolytic pathway through fructose-6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate metabolites that are formed by transketolase and transaldolase reactions (Fig.\n\n2B).\n\nTo verify this assumption, we tried to construct a mutant defective in the upper part of the glycolysis pathway.\n\nWe choose to inactivate the pgi gene encoding glucose-6-phosphate isomerase catalyzing isomerization of glucose-6-phosphate (Glu-6-P) to fructose-6-phosphate.\n\nWe predicted that in the presence of glucose, the Glu-6-P formed would enter the pentose phosphate pathway in this mutant (Fig.\n\n2B).\n\nThe required enzymes as well as the genes encoding enzymes Glu-6-P dehydrogenase and gluconate-6-P dehydrogenase are present in E.\n\nfaecalis (32).\n\nHowever, all attempts to obtain this mutant failed, suggesting that the upper part of the glycolysis pathway is essential in E.\n\nfaecalis.\n\nThe finding that a 2-fold reduction of phosphofructokinase activity strongly decreased the growth rate of the lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus lactis is in agreement with this conclusion (33).\n\nConstruction and screening of a transposon mutant library in E.\n\nfaecalis.To gather more insight into the correlation between catabolic pathway utilization and tolerance to bactericidal antibiotics, we created a genome-wide transposon mutant library in the E.\n\nfaecalis \u0394sodA mutant and screened it for variants with increased tolerance of vancomycin in the presence of glucose as the energy source.\n\nRecently, construction of a high-density transposon mutant library has been established for E.\n\nfaecium using a new transposon delivery plasmid named pZXL5 (22).\n\nWe therefore tested if this plasmid could also be a useful tool for transposon mutagenesis in E.\n\nfaecalis.\n\nWe started with the JH2-2 \u0394sodA mutant and analyzed the randomness of the transposon insertions by PCR.\n\nThe results showed that integration was not random in this background but that the transposon integrated preferentially into many regions (hot spots) of the chromosome (data not shown).\n\nWe then tested a previously constructed \u0394sodA mutant of E.\n\nfaecalis strain OG1RF (5).\n\nConstruction of the mutant library in this strain also revealed the presence of hot spots, but these were much less frequent than in the JH2-2 background (data not shown).\n\nTherefore, we decided to screen the library constructed in the OG1RF \u0394sodA mutant background.\n\nTo select transposon mutants with increased tolerance of vancomycin, the \u0394sodA mutant library was subjected to two rounds of exposure to 20\u00d7 MIC of vancomycin for 24 h.\n\nThe survivors of this procedure were plated, and colonies were individually tested for tolerance of the antibiotic.\n\nOf 150 colonies analyzed, 10 individual clones showed tolerance of the antibiotic treatment that was increased (between 1 and 2 orders of magnitude) in comparison to that seen with the OG1RF \u0394sodA control strain (Fig.\n\n3).\n\nThe insertion sites of the transposon were determined for the 10 clones, and the results showed that the transposon had integrated in three different intergenic regions (IGR1 to IGR3) (Fig.\n\n4).\n\nFor the majority (8 of 10) of the clones, the transposon had integrated into IGR1 at three different positions between genes EF_0102 and EF_0103.\n\nThe two divergent genes surrounding this IGR both encode arginine transcriptional regulators of the ArgR family.\n\nWe identified two clones in which the transposon had integrated 51 bp upstream of gene EF_0102 and five clones with an integration site 35 bp upstream of gene EF_0103, and in one clone, the transposon was situated 3 bp upstream of EF_0103.\n\nIn the case of IGR2 and IGR3, the transposon had integrated 1 bp upstream of a gene (EF_0676) encoding a putative ArgR repressor and in the middle of IGR3, respectively.\n\nThe adjacent genes of IGR3 encode a glycine/betaine ABC transporter (EF_3065) and a deformylase (EF_3066).\n\nSince 9 of the 10 clones appear to be involved in the regulation of arginine metabolism, we further focused our study on these transposon mutants.\n\nView larger version: In this window In a new window Download as PowerPoint Slide FIG 3 Relative survival rates of E.\n\nfaecalis OG1RF, \u0394sodA, and transposon mutants in the presence of vancomycin.\n\nSurvival of the OG1RF wild-type strain, its isogenic \u0394sodA mutant, and clones screened from the transposon library demonstrating partially restored tolerance (C2, C11, C13, C14, C41, C49, C50, C53, C56, and C57) was determined after 24 h of treatment with 20 \u03bcg/ml of vancomycin in GM17 medium.\n\nMean values of the results of at least three different experiments are represented with error bars indicating standard deviations.\n\nView larger version: In this window In a new window Download as PowerPoint Slide FIG 4 Mapping of insertion sites of the transposon in clones with partially restored tolerance of vancomycin.\n\nThe transposon (Tn) integrated into three different intergenic regions (IGR1 to IGR3).\n\nIn IGR1, the Tn integrated at three different positions between genes EF_0102 and EF_0103 encoding both putative arginine regulators (ArgR1and ArgR2).\n\nIn IGR2, the Tn integrated upstream of gene EF_0676, which encodes a putative arginine repressor (ArgR3).\n\nIn IGR3, the Tn inserted approximately in the center between genes EF_3065 and EF_3066, encoding a putative glycine/betaine ABC transporter (RpsO) and a putative deformylase (Def), respectively.\n\nNumbers above the insertion sites refer to the distances between the ends of the transposon and adjacent genes.\n\nAs mentioned above, in the majority of clones the transposon had integrated between two ArgR family regulators (EF_0102 and EF_0103).\n\nDirectly downstream of this region, genes related to arginine catabolism are present in E.\n\nfaecalis JH2-2.\n\nThese genes encode arginine deiminase (arcA; EF_0104), an ornithine carbamoyltransferase (arcF-1; EF_0105), and a carbamate kinase (arcC-1; EF_0106).\n\nThese three genes seem to be in an operon structure with two other genes encoding a putative Crp/Fnr transcriptional regulator (arcR; EF_0107) and a putative ornithine-arginine antiporter (arcD; EF_0108) (see Fig.\n\nS5 in the supplemental material) (15).\n\nDue to this context, we hypothesized that one or both ArgR regulators present upstream of the arginine deiminase (ADI) operon are implicated in the regulation of its expression and that insertion of the transposon modified expression of the regulator and hence also that of the ADI operon.\n\nThis was tested by reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), which showed that this was indeed the case (Table 2).\n\nIn clone 50, the transposon integrated 51 bp upstream of gene EF_0102 (Fig.\n\n4).\n\nCompared to the \u0394sodA mutant, expression of the EF_0102 gene was induced nearly 10-fold in clone 50.\n\nAnalysis of expression of the EF_0103 gene, which encodes the other ArgR regulator, showed that it was also induced in this Tn mutant, albeit to a (4-fold) lesser extent than EF_0102.\n\nFurthermore, genes of the ADI operon were highly (between 8-fold and 23-fold) induced in clone 50 (Table 2).\n\nIn clone 56, the transposon had integrated 35 bp upstream of EF_0103.\n\nThe RT-qPCR experiments revealed that, in comparison to the \u0394sodA mutant, EF_0103 expression in this clone was strongly repressed but expression of EF_0102 was induced around 8-fold.\n\nHowever, also in this Tn mutant, the ADI operon was highly (between 12-fold and 16-fold) induced.\n\nThis strongly suggests that induced expression of the ADI operon in the Tn mutants is due to induction of gene EF_0102, whose product acts as a transcriptional activator (see Fig.\n\nS5).\n\nView this table: In this window In a new window TABLE 2 Ratio of RT-qPCR values of clones 50, 56, and 49 to RT-qPCR values of \u0394sodA mutant In the case of clone 49 of group II, the transposon had integrated 1 bp upstream of gene EF_0676, which encodes a putative ArgR repressor.\n\nThis integration provoked very strong (125-fold) repression of the expression of this gene (Table 2).\n\nInterestingly, expression of the ADI operon was also significantly (between 9 and 14-fold) induced in this Tn mutant, suggesting that the product of gene EF_0676 may act as a transcriptional repressor of the ADI operon (see Fig.\n\nS5 in the supplemental material).\n\nOf note, the levels of expression of the EF_0102 and EF_0103 genes of clone 49 and the \u0394sodA mutant were comparable, and expression of EF_0676 was not modified in the Tn mutants with integration sites between genes EF_0102 and EF_0103 (clones 50 and 56) (Table 2).\n\nTaken together, these results strongly suggest that the increase in expression of the ADI operon is responsible for the increase of tolerance of vancomycin in the Tn mutants.\n\nWe reasoned therefore that inactivation of arginine catabolism should lead to a decrease of tolerance to this antibiotic, although we could not exclude the possibility that the increased expression of the Crp/Fnr family transcriptional regulator (arcR; EF_0107) which is part of the ADI operon was the basis of the increased tolerance.\n\nSo we decided to construct mutants with mutations of the first gene of the operon encoding arginine deiminase (arcA; EF_0104) but also, in parallel, to inactivate the arcR (EF_0107) gene by integration of plasmids containing internal fragments of the corresponding genes in both the JH2-2 wild-type strain and the \u0394sodA mutant strain.\n\nWhereas the arcA mutant was obtained without any difficulty in both backgrounds, all attempts to construct an arcR mutant failed.\n\nThe JH2-2 arcA mutant and the isogenic \u0394sodA arcA double mutant were then tested for tolerance of vancomycin.\n\nThe results showed that introduction of an arcA mutation into the JH2-2 wild-type strain had no effect on survival in the presence of 20\u00d7 MIC of vancomycin but that this mutation further decreased survival (20-fold, P = 0.05) of the \u0394sodA mutant under these conditions (Fig.\n\n5).\n\nFrom these results, we hypothesized that arginine catabolism may be important in E.\n\nfaecalis only under oxidative stress conditions, which we postulated to be the case in the SodA-deficient cells due to induction of a superoxide burst upon antibiotic treatment (4, 5).\n\nView larger version: In this window In a new window Download as PowerPoint Slide FIG 5 Relative survival rates after vancomycin treatment of E.\n\nfaecalis JH2-2 and isogenic mutant strains.\n\nSurvival of the wild-type strain and the arcA, \u0394sodA, and \u0394sodA arcA mutants was determined after 24 h of treatment with 20 \u03bcg/ml of vancomycin in GM17 medium.\n\nMean values of the results of at least three different experiments are represented with error bars indicating standard deviations.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section DISCUSSION The results presented in this communication contribute to the progression of the understanding of the extraordinary tolerance to bactericidal antibiotics of enterococci.\n\nAs we showed in this and previous work, tolerance is linked to their manganese-cofactored superoxide dismutase, and we postulated that loss of tolerance in Sod-deficient mutants is due to increased production of O2\u2212 upon antibiotic treatment (4, 5).\n\nThe new elements in the present work are that the formation of O2\u2212 depends not only on active catabolism but also on the kind of energy source that is present during treatment.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, this seems to be the first study demonstrating that, during drug treatment, in our case, treatment with vancomycin or penicillin, antibiotic-susceptible cells continue to consume the substrate but do not grow during exposure to the antibiotic.\n\nFurthermore, we showed that this consumption (and, therefore, an active metabolism) is a prerequisite for bactericidal antibiotics to exert their killing effect.\n\nThis strongly suggests the decoupling of energy production from the cell cycle, so a kind of high-engine-power-while-idling motion may be the basis of the increased production of O2\u2212.\n\nHowever, the molecular basis of this oxidative burst still remains unknown, although our report highlights the importance of the upper part of the glycolysis pathway in this context.\n\nThe present work also revealed a link between antibiotic tolerance and arginine catabolism.\n\nIn Tn mutants with an upregulated ADI operon, tolerance of the Sod-deficient strain was partially restored.\n\nThese results seem to support the above-mentioned oxidative-stress-based killing model, since a recent study demonstrated the direct implication of the ADI operon in the oxidative stress response of Lactococcus lactis (34).\n\nIn a spontaneously H2O2-resistant mutant of this species, the ADI operon was found to be upregulated and disruption of the first (arcA) or second (arcB) gene of this operon abolished peroxide resistance.\n\nIn analogy to these results, it can be suggested that the upregulation of the ADI operon in E.\n\nfaecalis protects the cells from oxidative stress.\n\nAs we postulate in the tolerance model, this occurs in \u0394sodA mutants treated with bactericidal cell wall-active antibiotics (Fig.\n\n6).\n\nThis interpretation is further supported by the results obtained with a double mutant affected in Sod activity and the ADI operon.\n\nThis strain was significantly less tolerant than a \u0394sodA single mutant.\n\nView larger version: In this window In a new window Download as PowerPoint Slide FIG 6 Proposed model for action of cell wall-active antibiotics in tolerant and nontolerant bacteria.\n\nRefer to the text for more-detailed information.\n\nRecently, two publications (35, 36) convincingly questioned the hitherto widely accepted model of how bactericidal antibiotics kill bacteria (37).\n\nThe cell death pathway model proposed that these drugs induce the creation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which at least contribute to cell killing (37).\n\nWe have previously published results obtained with E.\n\nfaecalis (4) which differed in important points from the model proposed by Kohanski et al.\n\n(37).\n\nSpecifically, neither the presumptive hydroxyl radical scavenger thiourea nor iron scavengers protected the SodA-deficient cells from killing.\n\nAdditionally, peroxidase/catalase mutants as well as DNA repair-deficient recA mutants were not more sensitive to bactericidal antibiotics than their wild-type parents (4).\n\nThese results are now in line with the new data published in the above-mentioned two studies (35, 36).\n\nHowever, seemingly in conflict with those two studies, which concluded that bactericidal antibiotics do not induce oxidative stress in E.\n\ncoli, we proposed that cell wall-active antibiotics do induce the creation of superoxide formation in enterococci.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the specific killing of \u0394sodA mutants of these bacteria and on the absence of killing under anaerobic conditions (4, 5).\n\nIn contrast to enterococci, E.\n\ncoli is not tolerant of bactericidal antibiotics and is rapidly killed (decrease of 3 to 4 orders of magnitude in 5 h) when exposed to them (35, 37) whereas 10% to 80% of enterococci survive a 24-h exposure to these drugs (4, 5).\n\nThe results obtained with E.\n\ncoli and enterococci allowed refining of the tolerance model we previously proposed for enterococci (4).\n\nNontolerant bacteria such as E.\n\ncoli are quickly killed by the primary actions of bactericidal antibiotics (Fig.\n\n6).\n\nEnterococci, however, are tolerant of these primary killing mechanisms.\n\nIn the long run, cell wall-active antibiotics induce the creation of superoxide radicals in these bacteria in a process which needs active metabolism during exposure to these drugs.\n\nIn wild-type bacteria, O2\u2212 is efficiently detoxified by SodA, leading to long-term tolerance.\n\nThe accumulation of ROS, and hence their deleterious effects, occurs only in SodA-deficient enterococci.\n\nHowever, killing is not immediate but starts more than 6 h after the exposure to antibiotics.\n\nThis delay in killing probably reflects the time necessary to accumulate O2\u2212 to a threshold concentration, at which point bacterial death occurs.\n\nThis refined model is now the basis for the design of new experiments which are aimed at further progress in the understanding of bacterial tolerance to cell wall-active antibiotics.\n\nIn addition, the results obtained from these studies may also be helpful to understand the survival phenotype of the so-called persisters which might be the cause of recurrent infections.\n\nIndeed, like enterococci, these specialized cells of a bacterial population are highly tolerant to bactericidal drugs.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank all members of the EA4655 U2RM-Stress et Virulence laboratory, in particular, Isabelle Rinc\u00e9, Aurelie Verneuil, Marie-Jeanne Pigny,

ABSTRACT De-escalation of empirical antibiotic therapy is often included in antimicrobial stewardship programs in critically ill patients, but differences in target attainment when antibiotics are switched are rarely considered.\n\nThe primary objective of this study was to compare the fractional target attainments of contemporary dosing of empirical broad-spectrum \u03b2-lactam antibiotics and narrower-spectrum antibiotics for a number pathogens for which de-escalation may be considered.\n\nThe secondary objective was to determine whether alternative dosing strategies improve target attainment.\n\nWe performed a simulation study using published population pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in critically ill patients for a number of broad-spectrum \u03b2-lactam antibiotics and narrower-spectrum antibiotics.\n\nSimulations were undertaken using a data set obtained from critically ill patients with sepsis without absolute renal failure (n = 49).\n\nThe probability of target attainment of antibiotic therapy for different microorganisms for which de-escalation was applied was analyzed.\n\nEUCAST MIC distribution data were used to calculate fractional target attainment.\n\nThe probability that therapeutic exposure will be achieved was lower for the narrower-spectrum antibiotics with conventional dosing than for the broad-spectrum alternatives and could drastically be improved with higher dosages and different modes of administrations.\n\nFor a selection of microorganisms, the probability that therapeutic exposure will be achieved was overall lower for the narrower-spectrum antibiotics using conventional dosing than for the broad-spectrum antibiotics.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section INTRODUCTION Provision of antibiotic therapy that is timely and of an appropriate spectrum is one of the mainstays of treatment (1, 2).\n\nThis has led to the widespread use of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy for the empirical treatment of infections.\n\nAfter identification of the causative microorganism, antibiotic therapy is typically adapted to the susceptibility profile of the microorganism, with a preference to change therapy to narrower-spectrum agents in order to decrease selective pressure for resistant pathogens.\n\nThis process is called antibiotic de-escalation and is considered an important element in antibiotic stewardship programs (3\u20135).\n\nAlthough the timing and adequacy of the antibiotic therapy remain crucial, recent data hint at the importance of antibiotic dosing and exposure on clinical outcome (6).\n\nChanges in the physiology of the critically ill alter the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, with many patients being at risk of being underdosed (7, 8).\n\nAttainment of PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) targets associated with efficacy is also dependent on the susceptibility of the pathogen and varies across antibiotic classes, an element that is rarely considered (8).\n\nAlthough de-escalation of antibiotic therapy is a key element in many antibiotic stewardship programs, the possible change in PK/PD target attainment in de-escalation has not yet been considered.\n\nDe-escalation has been associated with improved outcomes in many observational (nonrandomized) studies; however, these findings may be due to selection bias, as de-escalation may be mainly performed in patients who are improving (9, 10).\n\nA recent randomized controlled study performed by Leone et al.\n\n(11) found that de-escalation to narrower-spectrum antibiotics did not reduce patient intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay and was associated with an increased number of antibiotic days in patients in whom antibiotic therapy had been de-escalated.\n\nThe authors also reported that superinfections were more frequent in patients in whom antibiotic therapy had been de-escalated, with about half of the superinfections being caused by the same pathogens that caused the initial infection (11).\n\nBased on these observations, we hypothesized that PK/PD target attainment after de-escalation may be lower than that with empirical therapy, even when the pathogen is reported to be susceptible to the de-escalation antibiotic.\n\nThe primary objective of this study was to compare the probability that PK/PD targets will be achieved with conventional dosing of empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics and narrower-spectrum antibiotics for a number of pathogens for which de-escalation may occur.\n\nThe secondary objective was to determine whether PK/PD target attainment could be improved with alternative dosing strategies for both types of antibiotics.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed an in silico (computer) simulation study using published population pharmacokinetic studies in critically ill patients for a number of broad-spectrum \u03b2-lactam antibiotics (meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam) and narrower-spectrum antibiotics often used in de-escalation (amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefuroxime, flucloxacillin, cefazolin, and cefepime), as reported in recent studies (12\u201318).\n\nProtein binding was assumed to be 17% for amoxicillin, 33% for cefuroxime, and 10% for cefepime (19).\n\nProtein binding for meropenem is negligible, and the models for piperacillin, flucloxacillin, and cefazolin were based on measured free concentrations, so no correction was necessary.\n\nWe simulated 30-min infusions for all antibiotics, as intermittent infusion remains the most common method of administration in ICUs (6).\n\nTreatment with the broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics was also simulated as extended and continuous infusions, as these administration techniques are becoming more common as a way to maximize PK/PD target attainment (20).\n\nFor amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and piperacillin-tazobactam, doses for the amoxicillin or piperacillin component only were simulated because the PK/PD targets for the \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors in these combinations remain unclear.\n\nThe simulated dosages were derived from the package inserts and are summarized in Table 1.\n\nPK/PD target attainment of higher dosages and alternative dosing strategies were also investigated for the narrower-spectrum antibiotics.\n\nThe simulated dosages are summarized in Table 2.\n\nView this table: In this window In a new window TABLE 1 Simulated intravenous dosages of antibiotics View this table: In this window In a new window TABLE 2 Simulated dosages for the de-escalation antibiotics using higher dosages and alternative dosing strategies The simulations were performed using NONMEM (version 7.3.0; Globomax LLX, Hanover, MD, USA).\n\nA digital FORTRAN compiler was used, and the runs were executed using Wings for NONMEM (http://wfn.sourceforge.net).\n\nFor each antibiotic, 1,000 Monte Carlo simulations were undertaken using a patient data set (n = 49) with various creatinine clearances (range, 22 to 230 ml/min) and the parameters from the published covariate model.\n\nThis data set was obtained from a previous study conducted in a tertiary referral ICU (21).\n\nPatients were eligible for enrollment if they were between 18 and 80 years of age and were receiving piperacillin-tazobactam for the treatment of sepsis (defined as a presumed or confirmed infection, while manifesting a systemic inflammatory response syndrome).\n\nPatients were excluded if they did not have an intra-arterial line, had significant renal impairment (defined by a plasma creatinine concentration of >171 \u03bcmol/liter or the need for renal replacement therapy), or had a history of allergy to piperacillin or iodine.\n\nThis therefore represents a convenience sample of critically ill septic patients without significant renal impairment.\n\nThe patient characteristics are summarized in Table 3.\n\nView this table: In this window In a new window TABLE 3 Patient characteristicsa Using the simulated concentration-time profiles, the time for which the free antibiotic concentration exceeds the MIC (fT>MIC) was calculated for each simulated subject using linear interpolation.\n\nThe PK/PD target was set at 40% fT>MIC for carbapenems, 50% fT>MIC for penicillins, and 65% fT>MIC for cephalosporins, and this was defined as the conservative PK/PD target, which is the target found to be associated with the maximal effect in animal models (22).\n\nThere are almost no data on which targets are needed to treat infections in critically ill patients; however, there are some retrospective studies that have found that higher targets may be needed to treat serious infections in this patient population.\n\nTherefore, we performed an additional simulation with a higher target of 100% fT>MIC for all antibiotics (23, 24).\n\nThe microorganisms used in this simulation study were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Citrobacter freundii, Morganella morganii, and Proteus mirabilis, as these are microorganisms for which de-escalation is more commonly performed (9, 11, 25\u201327).\n\nMIC distribution data for each antibiotic for the pathogens indicated above were obtained from the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) to determine fractional target attainment (FTA) (28).\n\nThis identifies the likely success of treatment by comparing the achievement of the PK/PD target against an MIC distribution.\n\nMicroorganisms with an MIC above the clinical susceptible breakpoint were not included in the FTA calculation because ongoing prescription would not be supported by the susceptibility testing upon which the de-escalation is based.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section RESULTS Probability of attainment for the conservative PK/PD target.The results of the simulations for the conservative target are shown in Table 4.\n\nThe FTA for the conservative target for the broad-spectrum antibiotics administered as an intermittent infusion at high doses (piperacillin-tazobactam at 4 g every 6 h and meropenem at 1 g every 8 h) was >95% for all simulations, reaching 100% when administered as an extended or continuous infusion.\n\nThe FTA for piperacillin-tazobactam at a lower dose (4 g every 8 h) was slightly lower, with the lowest FTA being 89% for K.\n\npneumoniae, although this increased to 100% when administered as a continuous or extended infusion.\n\nView this table: In this window In a new window TABLE 4 FTA for different antibiotics, microorganisms, dosages, and modes of administration using the both the conservative and the high PK/PD targetsa For the narrower-spectrum antibiotics in conventional dosing, the FTA was lower than that for the broad-spectrum antibiotics.\n\nAs shown in Table 4, the FTA for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (1 g every 6 h) ranged from 85% (E.\n\ncoli) to 100% depending on the microorganism.\n\nThe lowest FTA for cefuroxime (1.5 g every 8 h) was 65% for E.\n\ncoli.\n\nFlucloxacillin (1 g every 6 h), cefepime (2 g every 12 h), and cefazolin (1 g every 8 h) had FTAs of, respectively, 74, 88, and 90% for oxacillin-susceptible S.\n\naureus.\n\nProbability of target attainment for the higher 100% fT>MIC target.The FTAs for the higher target of 100% fT>MIC are shown in Table 4.\n\nFor the broad-spectrum antibiotics, only the continuous infusion of meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam (piperacillin doses of 12 and 16 g/day) reached a 100% FTA for all studied microorganisms.\n\nThe FTA for meropenem (1 g every 8 h) administered as a 30-min infusion ranged from 100% (Streptococcus spp.) to 64% (oxacillin-susceptible S.\n\naureus), which increased to 87% when administered as a 4-h infusion and to 100% when administered as a continuous infusion.\n\nSimilarly, for piperacillin-tazobactam, an increase in the infusion time improved the FTA.\n\nWhen administered at 4 g every 6 h, the lowest FTA was 76% for K.\n\npneumoniae.\n\nIt was 87% for the 3-h infusion and increased to 100% for the continuous infusion.\n\nAt the lower dose, the FTA was only 62% for K.\n\npneumoniae, 77% when administered as a 4-h extended infusion, and 100% when administered as a continuous infusion.\n\nFor the de-escalation antibiotics, the FTA was also lower than that for the conservative target.\n\nThe lowest FTA for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (1 g every 6 h) was 66% for E.\n\ncoli, and the lowest FTA for cefuroxime was 45% for the standard dose of 1.5 g every 8 h for E.\n\ncoli.\n\nThe FTAs for flucloxacillin (1 g every 6 h) and cefepime (2 g every 12 h) for oxacillin-susceptible S.\n\naureus were similarly poor (36% and 69%, respectively), but the FTA for cefazolin (1 g every 8 h) was slightly better at 77%.\n\nFractional target attainment when administering higher dosages or using alternative modes of administration for the narrower-spectrum antibiotics.The FTAs obtained using the conservative targets for the higher dosages/alternative modes of administration are shown in Table 4.\n\nIncreasing the dose for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid from 1 g every 6 h to 1 g every 4 h increased the FTA using the conservative target for E.\n\ncoli from 85% to 92%, and the FTA was increased to 100% when an extended or continuous infusion of 6 g was used.\n\nSimilarly, for cefuroxime, increasing the dose and increasing the infusion time improved the FTA from 65% for E.\n\ncoli (conventional dose of 1.5 g every 8 h) to 98% when administered as a continuous infusion of 6 g.\n\nFor flucloxacillin, increasing the dose from 1 g every 6 h to 2 g every 6 h as an extended or continuous infusion increased the FTA for oxacillin-susceptible S.\n\naureus from 74 to 100%.\n\nFor cefazolin and cefepime, a continuous infusion of 4 g increased the FTA against oxacillin-susceptible S.\n\naureus from 88% (cefepime at 2 g every 12 h) and 90% (cefazolin at 1 g every 8 h) to 100% for both antibiotics.\n\nWhen using the higher target of 100% fT>MIC, there were large differences in the FTAs between the broad- and narrower-spectrum antibiotics (Table 4).\n\nHowever, changing the intermittent infusion to a higher-dose continuous infusion improved the FTA dramatically.\n\nFor amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, this improved the FTA from 66% (1 g every 6 h) to 98% (6 g continuously) for E.\n\ncoli, and for cefuroxime, this improved the FTA from 45% (1.5 g every 8 h) to 98% (6 g continuously) for E.\n\ncoli.\n\nFor flucloxacillin, in order to obtain a high FTA for oxacillin-susceptible S.\n\naureus, the dose needed to be increased from 1 g every 6 h (FTA, 36%) to 8 g as a continuous infusion (FTA, 100%), and for cefepime and cefazolin, the dose needed to be increased from 2 g every 12 h for cefepime (FTA, 69%) and 1 g every 8 h for cefazolin (FTA, 77%) to 4 g continuously (FTAs, 100%).\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section DISCUSSION De-escalation of antibiotic therapy, or the changing of therapy with an empirical antibiotic to one with a narrower-spectrum antibiotic, is often advocated to reduce the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics in the hospitalized patient (3, 29).\n\nIt is generally considered safe, has been associated with improved outcomes in several observational studies, and is recommended in the 2013 Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines (9, 10, 30).\n\nAs such, it is often incorporated into antibiotic stewardship programs in critically ill patients (31, 32), although in clinical practice there seem to be a number of obstacles to its widespread use (33).\n\nIn observational studies, empirical antibiotics are de-escalated in roughly 15 to 50% of the patients, depending on the definition used (9, 25, 33, 34).\n\nIn this study, we have found that for a number of pathogens, the fractional target attainment (FTA) was higher for the empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam than for the narrower-spectrum antibiotics amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefuroxime, flucloxacillin, cefazolin, and cefepime using conventional dosing.\n\nGiven that the probability that the PK/PD target for some microorganism-antibiotic combinations will be achieved is lower for the narrower-spectrum alternative, de-escalation with standard dosing may predispose selected patients to clinical failure and recurrent infection.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of its kind to compare the achievement of therapeutic exposure by empirical antibiotic therapy with the achievement of therapeutic exposure by de-escalation of antibiotic therapy on the basis of population PK models from critically ill patients.\n\nAlthough there is currently no evidence that subtherapeutic dosing of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics leads to treatment failure or to a higher incidence of resistance, this has been shown for other antibiotics.\n\nFor tobramycin, for example, it has been shown that although the peak concentration/MIC is associated with the maximal effect, for the same area under the curve/MIC value, once-daily dosing (with subsequent lower trough concentrations) leads to higher MIC values than three-times-daily dosing after 2 weeks of treatment (35).\n\nThe FTA is dependent on a number of factors, and recent insights into PK/PD characteristics in critically ill patients may help us to explain these findings.\n\nBecause of pathophysiological changes in critically ill patients, such as an increased volume of distribution and augmented renal clearance, standard dosing may not always lead to optimal target attainment (36, 37).\n\nMoreover, it is also dependent on the PK/PD target (40% fT>MIC for carbapenems versus 65% fT>MIC for cephalosporins).\n\nNext, the susceptibility of the microorganism plays an important role.\n\nThe susceptibility of the same microorganism may vary for different antibiotics, and similarly, the potencies of certain antibiotics against different microorganisms may be different, even though all microorganisms are reported to be susceptible (38).\n\nMoreover, the PK/PD target is currently considered to be fixed; however, it has never been investigated if the PK/PD target changes over time.\n\nA changing PK/PD target over time, not taken into account by dosing, could also result in treatment failure and the emergence of resistance.\n\nFinally, an increasing proportion of ICUs are administering meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam as an extended or continuous infusion, as a way to increase PK/PD target attainment (6, 20).\n\nHowever, these alternative modes of administration are not used for the narrower-spectrum antibiotics, which are still being administered as short infusions with standard doses (6).\n\nThis contrasting approach could further increase the gap in PK/PD target attainment between empirical and de-escalated antibiotic therapy.\n\nThe findings of our study may partly explain the findings of a recent de-escalation study that could not confirm noninferiority when comparing de-escalation to continuation of the empirical therapy (11).\n\nLeone et al.\n\n(11) found in a randomized controlled trial not carried out in a blind manner that antibiotic use was higher in patients in whom therapy had been de-escalated due to an increased number of superinfections, about half of which were caused by the same pathogen that caused the primary infection.\n\nThis suggests that the antibiotics used in the de-escalation arm were less effective in eradicating the infection than the broad-spectrum antibiotics in the comparative arm.\n\nIn that study, no details regarding dosing were reported (11).\n\nOf the most recent de-escalation studies, only one has mentioned the dose and mode of administration of the initial broad-spectrum regimen, but it did not mention these data about the de-escalated antibiotics (11, 25\u201327).\n\nAnother study mentioned that \u201cthe dose and pattern of administration were in accordance with current medical standards\u201d (9).\n\nDosing may be the key to improve patient outcome, as recent data have demonstrated that there is a correlation between the blood concentrations of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics and clinical outcome (6).\n\nFuture de-escalation studies should ensure that dosing and the mode of administration of the narrower-spectrum antibiotics are likely to achieve appropriate PK/PD targets.\n\nWe could also demonstrate that PK/PD target attainment is drastically improved when higher dosages and different modes of administration of the de-escalation antibiotics are used.\n\nHowever, it must also be highlighted that blindly increasing the dose in all patients may give rise to needlessly high concentrations in some of them.\n\nAlthough \u03b2-lactams are not commonly toxic, toxicity is severe when it occurs, with seizures from high concentrations being reported previously (39\u201341).\n\nThis wide pharmacokinetic variability suggests that the principle of one dose fits all is unlikely to be appropriate in this patient population (42).\n\nThere are a number of limitations of the current analysis that we would like to discuss.\n\nThese results are not based on measured concentrations from actual patients.\n\nHowever, we have simulated concentrations using population pharmacokinetic models and relevant covariates in critically ill patients.\n\nAs such, the accuracy of the results can be assumed to be acceptable, given that the same approach was used for simulations with the empirical and de-escalation antibiotic.\n\nThe patient population simulated consisted of patients who had normal renal function (serum creatinine concentration, <171 \u03bcmol/liter) and did not include patients with acute kidney injury, and therefore, these conclusions are relevant only to this patient group.\n\nAlso, there is little knowledge on which PK/PD target should be aimed for in critically ill patients, as the targets are derived from animal models on day 1 or 2 of antibiotic therapy.\n\nWhether or not this PK/PD target changes over time as a result of the changing susceptibility or the adaptive resistance of the pathogen is also a remaining question.\n\nMoreover, there is no time dependency of the data.\n\nIn clinical practice, de-escalation is generally performed when the patient is improving (and therefore, the pharmacokinetic issues associated with critical illness may be partly normalized) and has a lower bacterial burden.\n\nThis cannot be accounted for in the modeling.\n\nFinally, only 7 antibiotics were simulated, due to the unavailability of population pharmacokinetic models of other \u03b2-lactam antibiotics in critically ill patients, although these are all commonly used agents, making these data of significant interest to many ICU clinicians.\n\nConclusion.For a selection of microorganisms in which de-escalation may be considered, the results of this simulation study show that the probability that the PK/PD target will be achieved was lower for the narrower-spectrum antibiotics amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefuroxime, flucloxacillin, cefazolin, and cefepime using conventional dosing than the broad-spectrum antibiotics meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam.\n\nAs this may impact clinical outcome parameters, studies that report on the results of de-escalation strategies should accurately report the dosing of the antibiotics used.\n\nFuture research should be focused on correct dosing not only of broad-spectrum antibiotics but also of narrower-spectrum antibiotics, where higher dosages and alternative modes of administration may be needed for patients at risk of not achieving PK/PD targets.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section

{"content": "AbstractWe need to find ways of enhancing the potency of existing antibiotics, and, with this in mind, we begin with an unusual question: how low can antibiotic dosages be and yet bacterial clearance still be observed?\n\nSeeking to optimise the simultaneous use of two antibiotics, we use the minimal dose at which clearance is observed in an in vitro experimental model of antibiotic treatment as a criterion to distinguish the best and worst treatments of a bacterium, Escherichia coli.\n\nOur aim is to compare a combination treatment consisting of two synergistic antibiotics to so-called sequential treatments in which the choice of antibiotic to administer can change with each round of treatment.\n\nUsing mathematical predictions validated by the E.\n\ncoli treatment model, we show that clearance of the bacterium can be achieved using sequential treatments at antibiotic dosages so low that the equivalent two-drug combination treatments are ineffective.\n\nSeeking to treat the bacterium in testing circumstances, we purposefully study an E.\n\ncoli strain that has a multidrug pump encoded in its chromosome that effluxes both antibiotics.\n\nGenomic amplifications that increase the number of pumps expressed per cell can cause the failure of high-dose combination treatments, yet, as we show, sequentially treated populations can still collapse.\n\nHowever, dual resistance due to the pump means that the antibiotics must be carefully deployed and not all sublethal sequential treatments succeed.\n\nA screen of 136 96-h-long sequential treatments determined five of these that could clear the bacterium at sublethal dosages in all replicate populations, even though none had done so by 24 h.\n\nThese successes can be attributed to a collateral sensitivity whereby cross-resistance due to the duplicated pump proves insufficient to stop a reduction in E.\n\ncoli growth rate following drug exchanges, a reduction that proves large enough for appropriately chosen drug switches to clear the bacterium.\n\nAuthor Summary So-called \u201ccocktail\u201d treatments are often proposed as a way of enhancing the potency of antibiotics, based on the idea that multiple drugs can synergise when used together as part of a single combined therapy.\n\nWe investigated whether any other multidrug deployment strategies are as effective as\u2014or perhaps even better than\u2014synergistic antibiotic combinations at reducing bacterial densities.\n\n\u201cCollateral sensitivities\u201d between antibiotics are frequently observed; this is when measures taken by a bacterium to counter the presence of one antibiotic sensitise it to the subsequent use of another.\n\nOur approach was to see if we could exploit these sensitivities by first deploying one drug, then removing it and instead deploying another, and then repeating this process.\n\nThis is not an entirely new idea, and there is a precedence for this form of treatment that has been trialled in the clinic for Helicobacter pylori infection.\n\nThe idea we pursued here is an extension of \u201csequential treatment\u201d; we investigated whether with two antibiotics and n rounds of treatment, if we search within the set of all possible 2n \u201csequential treatments\u201d\u2014including the two single-drug monotherapies\u2014there might be treatments within that set that are more effective than the equivalent two-drug cocktail.\n\nUsing a simple in vitro treatment model, we show that some sequential-in-time antibiotic treatments are successful under conditions that cause the failure of the cocktail treatment when implemented at the equivalent dosage.\n\nCitation: Fuentes-Hernandez A, Plucain J, Gori F, Pena-Miller R, Reding C, Jansen G, et

retrospect that resistance has developed to every antibiotic in clinical use [1], with the genes responsible disseminated globally [2,3].\n\nAntibiotic resistance, therefore, has the potential to become a very grave problem.\n\nBacteria evolve so rapidly, in fact, that whole-genome sequencing studies have been able to elucidate dozens of de novo drug-resistance mutations occurring at high frequency within a clinical patient\u2019s infection during a 12-wk treatment [4].\n\nGiven this, the following seems an important question: what ways of combining antibiotics might be used to combat infection even when the bacterial species in question exhibits rapid decreases in drug susceptibility during treatment?\n\nOr, to put it differently, how can we enlarge the \u201coptimisation space\u201d of antibiotic combinations and search within those for novel, effective treatments?\n\nOne possibility may lie with so-called sequential treatments.\n\nThey have been the subject of several recent laboratory studies [5\u20137] and clinical trials [8,9] in which the idea is to alternate the use of different antibiotic classes through time.\n\nThus, if, for example, two antibiotics are available and n rounds of treatment are to be given, then there are 2n different ways of administering the drugs.\n\nOur hypothesis states that this exponentially large optimisation space can contain more effective treatments than the equivalent two-drug combination treatment when the same dosages of each antibiotic are applied.\n\nWe demonstrate the veracity of this claim in one particular in vitro laboratory model that mimics something of the gravity of the situation we now face by using a bacterium that possesses a scalable drug efflux mechanism that quickly reduces the efficacy of the antibiotics at our disposal.\n\nDespite this mechanism, we show that sequential treatments can clear the bacterium when the equivalent combination treatment fails to, provided, that is, that the drugs are deployed in a suitably optimised, sequential manner.\n\nTo demonstrate this, we use the following laboratory system.\n\nEscherichia coli K12 (AG100) is targeted with two antibiotics, erythromycin (a macrolide, ERY) and doxycycline (a tetracycline, DOX), that bind to different ribosomal RNA subunits, thereby inhibiting translation.\n\nWhile this is a nonclinical drug pairing, the commercial drug Synercid (comprising quinupristin and dalfopristin) also targets ribosomal RNA combinatorially [10].\n\nMoreover, some clinical combinations have ambiguous pharmacological interactions that can appear antagonistic in vitro [11,12], whereas the ERY\u2014DOX pairing has an established synergy [13,14].\n\nBefore continuing, we need to declare a standard notational device that we will use throughout.\n\nIt defines how antibiotic efficacy is measured, independently of the drug under study.\n\nThus, ICx will denote the antibiotic concentration that reduces the density of the ancestral bacterial strain (AG100), rather than (for example) any other fitness measure, exponential growth rate, or area under a growth curve, by a factor x% relative to that produced without antibiotic in any single period of bacterial growth.\n\nNow, E.\n\ncoli is known to decrease susceptibility to ERY and DOX by amplifying a genomic region that contains the operon acrRAB because a multidrug pump is formed from the products of acrRAB and tolC [13,15].\n\nSelection for amplification mutations occurs even when the drugs are combined at high concentrations whereupon pump duplications and triplications are observed [16].\n\nThe triplications permit bacteria subjected to 5 d of combination treatment at twice IC95 dosages, and thus at very low population densities, to eventually restore their growth rates and population densities to almost untreated levels [16].\n\nIn these circumstances, the successful clearance of E.\n\ncoli using sublethal dosages of ERY and DOX appears implausible.\n\nLow-dose monotherapies are unlikely to work [17], and combining the antibiotics into a synergistic IC50 cocktail (that achieves IC90 overall because of the synergy) is known to be futile because of resistance increases provided by the pump duplications [13].\n\nWe therefore turn to sequential treatments, an approach that has been used to treat cancers [18\u201320] and some clinical infections [9].\n\nThese might also appear predestined to fail; after all, cross drug collateral sensitivities are believed to be the basis of successful sequential treatments [7], whereas our model system, by contrast, has a scalable multidrug pump at its disposal.\n\nNevertheless, to evaluate the impact of extended antibiotic treatments, we propagated populations of E.\n\ncoli in 96-well microtitre plates containing liquid medium supplemented with antibiotics based on 12-h cycles, aka seasons, of growth.\n\nThus, two drug treatments per day were administered.\n\nAt the end of each season, 1% of the spent liquid media, containing biomass, was transferred to a plate containing fresh medium and antibiotics, where growth could resume.\n\nThe media was supplemented with enough glucose that this protocol would not clear the bacterium in the absence of drug but would instead establish a near-constant, season-by-season total observed population density of about 108 cells per ml in stationary phase (as can be discerned from Fig S1 and Fig S7 in S1 Text).\n\nGiven this model, we sought antibiotic treatments capable of clearing the bacterium.\n\nResults Low-Dose (IC50) and Mid-Dose (IC70) Sequential Drug Screens By the term sequential treatment, we mean the following protocol: one of the two drugs is used in season 1, and, whether ERY or DOX, it may be re-used in season 2, or, alternatively, the other drug may be deployed instead.\n\nThis process then continues each season until treatment ends.\n\nFor a treatment of eight seasons, there are 28\u20132 = 254 possible sequential protocols (minus the two monotherapies).\n\nHowever, seeking to understand whether drug switches per se reduce population growth, only balanced sequential treatments that use four seasons of both drugs were trialled (Fig S6 in S1 Text, section 1).\n\nSeeking evidence of successful low-dose treatments, we first treated E.\n\ncoli with ERY and DOX for eight seasons at dosages corresponding to the IC50 of each drug, implementing the following treatments: two monotherapies, one 50/50 combination using a half dose of both drugs (achieving approximately IC90, Fig S3 and Fig S4 in S1 Text, section 1) in addition to 70 sequential treatments (three replicates each).\n\nAn analogous screen of sequential treatments was then implemented at IC70 dosages (but only 66 of these sequential treatments were implemented).\n\nFig.\n\n1 summarises the IC50 data.\n\nIn Fig.\n\n1A, the 50/50 combination treatment achieves greater single-season inhibition than each monotherapy, as expected from prior reports of synergy (p<10-7, test as indicated in Fig S3 in S1 Text).\n\nHowever, by 36 h the combination therapy no longer produces the lowest bacterial densities, and by 96 h it produces high final densities (Fig.\n\n1A and Fig.\n\n1B), higher than the mean of the family of sequential treatments (p<10-8,F(1,69)\u224847.1, one-way ANOVA).\n\nAlthough a sequential treatment has the lowest final density of all those trialled (Fig.\n\n1A), no IC50 treatment provided any evidence of eliminating the bacteria by 96 h.\n\nDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Fig 1.\n\nAt IC50 dosages, population recovery is fastest for the 50/50 combination treatment and slowest for a sequential treatment.(A) Mean densities are shown at the end of each season for all sequential treatments at IC50 (as blue and green dots) and for the 50/50 combination of both drugs (black dotted line).\n\nThe treatment maximising inhibition in season 1 (at 12 h) is the 50/50 combination treatment, because of the synergy.\n\nHowever, by season 8 (at 96 h), all sequential treatments produce lower mean densities than the 50/50 treatment, out of which the lowest density obtained from all the treatments tested is indicated by red circles.\n\nAlso shown are mean final densities (see x-label \u201cmeans\u201d) of the 50/50 treatment (black circle), the best sequential treatment (red circle), and of all sequential treatments (green circle \u00b1 SE, three replicates per treatment).\n\n(B) A forest plot showing densities obtained using different sequential treatments at 96 h relative to the 50/50 treatment (drug orders are illustrated by the blue and green boxes on the left).\n\nThe vertical black line represents the mean density for the 50/50 combination, the vertical dashed line is the mean of all the sequential treatments, and the dots mark the deviation in density produced from the 50/50 combination treatment (\u00b1 SE, n = 3).\n\nLike (A), this shows that the combination treatment performs at the poorest extreme of the distribution of all sequential treatments measured in terms of how bacterial growth is suppressed by 96 h.\n\nThere is no evidence of bacterial clearance in any treatment.\n\n(S1 Data contains the data used in this figure.) http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002104.g001After increasing dosages to their IC70 values, the following evidence of bacterial clearance by 96 h was observed.\n\nSixteen sequential treatments that produced some of the lowest population densities after 96 h of treatment (treatments marked with boxes in Fig.\n\n2A) were examined, and, using spot tests, we could isolate no live cells for five of these treatments in all three replicates.\n\nThe 11 remaining treatments lead to a zero cell count in some replicates but not in all (Fig S15 in S1 Text, section 3).\n\nWe then replicated all 16 treatments an additional three times, and the five previously successful treatments again produced a zero cell count by 96 h, although the remaining 11 treatments showed substantial between-replicate variability in their population dynamics (Fig S15).\n\nBy contrast, Fig.\n\n2B shows that the 50/50 combination treatment (with a greater inhibition than IC70 due to the synergy) and both monotherapies yielded recovering (i.e., increasing) mean population densities beyond 48 h at these dosages.\n\n(In addition, we recall that twice IC95 combinations of these drugs can fail in this treatment model too [16].) However, these observations serve to illustrate that appropriately optimised, sequential therapies at IC70 can clear a bacterium even when synergistic combination treatments with greater one-season inhibition do not.\n\nDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Fig 2.\n\nSome examples of successful sequential treatments at IC70 dosages.(A) This Manhattan plot at IC70 shows the mean total optical densities observed during eight seasons of treatment (\u03a30D(T) on the vertical axis, vertical lines are SE, and n = 3).\n\nNote the 16 treatments marked with a red or black square: they had among the lowest final densities of the treatments trialled.\n\nAfter this, the 16 treatments were replicated; a red square shows that a zero cell density was observed in all three initial and subsequent replicates of that treatment, and black squares show a zero population density was observed in some, but not all, replicates.\n\n(B) The no-drug, ERY, and DOX monotherapies and the 50/50 combination treatment all produce recovering mean population densities at IC70 doses.\n\nThese four unsuccessful treatments are shown next to the optical density dynamics of three replicates of a successful \u201cred square\u201d treatment from (A) (treatment C in panel C).\n\nThe three replicates (shown as grey lines with blue [DOX] and green [ERY] circles) indicate parallel dynamics and fluctuating decay towards zero (bars are SE of optical density at 96 h, n = 3).\n\n(C) Season-by-season mean densities of all the successful (red square) treatments from (A); note how two achieve high densities early during treatment.\n\nFig S15 in S1 Text, section 3, shows colony-forming units for replicates of these treatments.\n\n(S1 Data contains the data used in this figure.) http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002104.g002In order to determine genetic changes due to the differential stresses found in drug-free conditions and in the sequential and combination treatments, two treatments at IC50 that produced comparable densities at 96 h were subjected to a whole-genome sequencing analysis and compared to the drug-free populations (S1 Text, section 4).\n\nWriting \u201cE\u201d for a season of ERY and \u201cD\u201d for DOX, when metagenomes from the EDEDEDED and 50/50 combination treatments were sequenced, known resistance mutations were observed in both.\n\nFig.\n\n3B highlights a 412 Kb genomic region containing the acrRAB operon whose duplication was observed more frequently in both the combination and sequential treatments at 96 h (namely, eight seasons) than at 24 h (or two seasons; Fisher exact test for both, p = 0.05; Fig S17 in S1 Text, section 4).\n\nTreating sequentially does not, therefore, avert selection for duplications of the acrRAB operon.\n\nDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Fig 3.\n\nThe rate of adaptation has a complex relationship with antibiotic dose.(A) Using IC50 dosages, growth rate adaptation (denoted \u03b1 when defined in [14]) is greater for the 50/50 combination than for the EDEDEDED (\u201cERY\u2014DOX\u201d) and DEDEDEDE (\u201cDOX\u2014ERY\u201d) sequential treatments.\n\nAdaptation can also be faster in the absence, rather than in the presence, of antibiotics.\n\nThe right-hand plot shows each replicate separately (as a dot), indicating treatment clusters as coloured regions using the convex hulls of the datasets for each treatment type (whether no drug or single drug monotherapies, the 50/50 two-drug combination, or a sequential treatment).\n\nThis shows sequential treatments minimise both final growth rate after eight seasons and the rate of adaptation.\n\n(B) Differences in the rate of adaptation in (A) are not accounted for by the duplication of the acrRAB operon, and sequential treatments do not prevent pump duplications.\n\nThese coverage plots from sequenced populations at 24 h and 96 h show that both the combination (50/50) and sequential treatments (ERY/DOX) lead to the duplication of a genomic region from 273 Kb to 686 Kb that contains acrRAB.\n\nLeft: the duplication was absent from all treatments after 24 h.\n\nRight: the duplication (the dark sector) is present in both the 50/50 combination and ERY\u2014DOX sequential treatments after 96 h, but not in the no-drug control.\n\nSingle nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are highlighted as arrowheads next to the treatment in which they were observed.\n\n(S1 Data contains the data used in this figure.) http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002104.g003We sought evidence for triplications of acrRAB by asking whether the ratio of coverage depths between amplified and nonamplified genomic regions was above a value of 2, the latter being the maximum value possible of this statistic if no triplications were present.\n\nHowever, at 96 h, in neither the sequential treatment (one-sided t test, p\u22480.12,T\u22481.68,n = 3) nor the 50/50 combination treatment (one-sided t-test, p\u22480.061,T\u22482.60,n = 3) was this value significantly above 2.\n\nFinally, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were observed in the putative drug transporter gene mdtG (yceE [21]) in all conditions (Table S3 in S1 Text, section 4); this member of the marA-soxS-rob stress regulon mediates expression of the acrAB-tolC pump [22].\n\nWe expected the rate of adaption (defined as a rate of increase in growth rate [14]) to correlate positively with dose.\n\nInstead, we observed that adaptation can be just as rapid in the absence as in the presence of antibiotics (Fig.\n\n3A), and our culture conditions may explain this.\n\nSlow growing cells, like persister phenotypes [23] and small colony variants [24], are cleared by our protocol, whereas cells that achieve rapid growth above approximately 6.6 generations every 12 h can survive.\n\nRapid bacterial growth is associated with physiological changes that include negative DNA supercoiling and multiple DNA replication forks per cell [25], increased cell size [26], and heightened ribosomal demand [27].\n\nThe latter likely induced a stringent response in the fastest growth conditions (the absence of drug).\n\nIn these conditions, SNPs associated with fatty acid degradation, lipid peroxidation stress, and sulphur transportation (tauA) were observed, the latter at high frequency (Table S3 in S1 Text, section 4).\n\nAs tauA is expressed in our growth media only during cysteine limitation [28], overcoming \u03b1-amino acid starvation is a likely mechanism supporting the SNPs detected in all seven 23S ribosomal RNA operons (rrn) of E.\n\ncoli by 96 h in the absence of drugs (Table S1 in S1 Text, section 4).\n\nAlthough mutations in the same rrn loci were observed at low frequency at 96 h in the slower-growing populations treated sequentially with drugs, none of these operons were mutated in populations treated with the drug combination.\n\nWe hypothesise, therefore, that the antibiotics have slowed the rise and sweep of adaptive mutations needed for optimal growth in our culture conditions (Table S1 in S1 Text, section 4).\n\nFinally, we found no significant evidence of SNPs within drug targets in any conditions (S1 Text, section 4).\n\nNonreciprocal Collateral Sensitivity Antibiotic combinations are used to slow drug-resistance adaptation because they enhance their antibacterial effect through inhibitory synergisms [29] and because they reduce the number of potential resistance mutations.\n\nHere, consistent with prior studies of ERY\u2014DOX combinations [13], growth rate adaptation is so rapid when using ERY and DOX in a synergistic IC70 combination that the bacterium is not cleared (Fig.\n\n1A, Fig.\n\n2B, Fig.\n\n3A), and an analogous observation has already been made at double IC95 dosages [16].\n\nCollateral sensitivities on the other hand, in which the prior use of one antibiotic sensitises the bacterium to the use of another, have few recognised mechanisms [30], but they too have been proposed as a possible basis for successful sequential treatments [7,31] because the change of environment hampers adaptation.\n\nPromisingly, the rate of adaptation is demonstrably lower here for sequential treatments than for combinations (Fig.\n\n3A; p<10-4,F(2,21)\u224816.8, one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction).\n\nHowever, it has also been suggested that the antibiotic sequences should follow optimised pathways through networks of drug choices that maximally sensitise the bacterium to treatment [7].\n\nHowever, E.\n\ncoli AG100 has pumps for both ERY and DOX, and we might therefore expect to observe cross-resistance, not collateral sensitivity, for this drug pair and this bacterium [6].\n\nIt therefore appears we do not have enough drugs for drug cycling to work in this model, but it will turn out, in fact, that we do.\n\nThis is because at least two cross sensitivity properties are observed.\n\nThe first of these, which was noted recently for doxycycline [6], we term nonreciprocal collateral sensitivity (NCS), and it is defined as follows.\n\nLabel two drugs \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d and choose equivalent dosages for both, meaning ICx for some x, and let D(T1,T2) denote density of the population when treatment T2 follows treatment T1.\n\nWe will also use the notation An and Bn to denote monotherapies with n rounds of treatment.\n\nNow, suppose we begin with a clonal population and treat with A for n+1 time units so that D(An,A) denotes the population density after the (n+1)-th treatment.\n\nThen, in a separate experiment, we treat with A for n time units followed by B for one time unit so that D(An,B) denotes the final population density.\n\nA nonreciprocal collateral sensitivity between A and B is said to occur when the switch from A to B results in a density decrease so that D(An,B)<D(An,A), whereas an analogous switch from B to A results in a density increase, meaning D(Bn,A)>D(Bn,B).\n\nWhen satisfied, this definition means A-adapted populations appear sensitised to drug B, whereas B-adapted populations have increased resistance to A.\n\nIf present, an NCS demonstrates that single-season inhibitory values cannot be used to infer the later inhibitory effect of antibiotics as the treatment proceeds; thus, ICX values and rate of adaptation measures capture very different properties of the bacterium.\n\nFor example, despite both drugs having equivalent inhibitory effects on a wild-type population after one dose, drug-resistance mutations could sweep more rapidly for one drug than the other, and this could result in an NCS.\n\nNevertheless, if the observed collateral sensitivity is much larger than the cross-resistance within a dataset that indicates the presence of an NCS, appropriately chosen sequential regimens may still be sufficiently potent to eliminate the bacterium.\n\nPostulating a Mechanism That Supports Nonreciprocal Collateral Sensitivity We first sought collateral sensitivities within the entire dataset shown in Fig.\n\n2A but found no significant evidence (Fig S12 in S1 Text, section 3) that a switch from ERY to DOX had a different effect on population density than switching from DOX to ERY.\n\nWe therefore tested for the presence of an NCS using a simpler \u201c(n+1)-protocol\u201d: n seasons of culture with one drug, followed by a switch to the other drug for just one season\u2019s duration.\n\nThis protocol (Fig.\n\n4) shows that when AG100 is treated with ERY for n seasons (of 24 h duration) and DOX on the (n+1)-th season, both at IC70, the continued increase in bacterial density on the last season is consistent with cross-resistance (see Fig.\n\n4B for p-values).\n\nHowever, when treating with DOX for n seasons and then ERY on the (n+1)-th, a density reduction is observed on the last treatment, consistent with a collateral sensitivity (Fig.\n\n4B).\n\nThis drug pair therefore possesses an NCS: although both inhibit growth of wild-type E.\n\ncoli equally, they report different levels of inhibition on drug-adapted populations.\n\nDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Fig 4.\n\nA nonreciprocal collateral sensitivity at IC70 dosages with respect to population densities.(A) The concentration of each drug was calibrated to ensure IC70 was achieved for both drugs, here at 18 h.\n\n(B) A nonreciprocal collateral sensitivity (NCS) determined using the (n+1)-protocol described in the text, where n = 3,4,\u2026,7: the change in densities following a change in antibiotic demonstrates ERY \u2192 DOX cross-resistance but DOX \u2192 ERY cross sensitivity (p-values from t tests, n = 5).\n\n(S1 Data contains the data used in this figure.) http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002104.g004This observation accords with predictions of the following theoretical model [13]: (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) where j = 2,\u2026,N-1 is a parameter that controls the number of efflux genes each cell can express.\n\nEquations 1\u20138 capture the densities, bj, of bacteria with duplications of a gene that exports drugs from within the cell.\n\nAt time t, S is the concentration of a limiting carbon source, Dext and Eext are extracellular concentrations of each drug, DOX and ERY respectively, Dj and Ej are the intracellular drug concentrations, and drugs degrade at rates dD and dE.\n\nThe variable pj represents the expected number of efflux pumps expressed by a cell with j-1 efflux genes, for each j\u22652.\n\nWe also assume that p1 = 0 so that it is possible for cells to encode the pump without expressing it (meaning genotypes for which j = 1 have the efflux gene but do not express it).\n\nMore generally, the nonzero quantity pj+1 is defined, for j\u22651, by j/(1+\u03b3\u2219j)), and then pj/(ke+pj) is the probability that a given drug molecule is bound to an efflux pump.\n\nThis model is a simplification of the competition each transcription unit has for each efflux operon (the acrRAB promoter), whereby a diminishing return is present in the number of pumps expressed as the number of efflux genes increases; the rate of diminishing returns is controlled by \u03b3>0.\n\nIncreases and decreases in the number of efflux genes in a cell are assumed to be a Poisson process with parameter \u03b4 per cell per hour.\n\nOther variables in Equations 1\u20138 have the following meaning: \u03c6e,\u03c6d are antibiotic diffusion rates across the cell membrane, \u03bde,vd are maximal drug efflux rates, and ke,kd are half-saturation constants associated with pump-antibiotic binding; V and K are maximal uptake rate and half-saturation constants associated with a Michaelis-Menten uptake model of the limiting carbon source (S); growth rate G(S,D,E) = cVS/((1+keE+\u03badD+\u03baedED)(K+S)) is proportional to uptake rate via a per-sugar biomass yield constant c, and G(S, D, E) is reduced in value synergistically by the drugs (where \u03bae,\u03bad and \u03baed are parameters that control drug efficacy and strength of synergy); \u03b4 is the rate of amplification of the efflux gene, and \u03b4(1+\u0394), a value necessarily greater than \u03b4, is the rate of loss of the gene.\n\nN-1 is the maximum number of copies of the efflux gene.\n\nWe set N = 3 to represent three different cell phenotypes: an unexpressed pump gene (a wild type), a single expressed pump gene, and one additional copy of that gene in which both copies are expressed.\n\nFinally, the model is simulated with several seasons so as to mimic the in vitro protocol, with the loss of 99% of all cells implemented at the end of each season.\n\nEquations 1\u20138 were solved numerically using a parameterisation determined from a prior training dataset (S1 Text, section 5) [13].\n\nAlthough our theory does not capture all aspects of our data, computations show that, like E.\n\ncoli, the model possesses an NCS (Fig.\n\n5).\n\nThe model predicts that a pump asymmetry due to different efflux efficiencies of ERY and DOX produces populations with differential susceptibility to each drug resulting from having different frequencies of drug-susceptible wild-type cells existing in mutation-selection equilibrium with less susceptible mutants (Fig.\n\n5A).\n\nSupporting the hypothesis of different efflux efficiencies of ERY and DOX, data from the E.\n\ncoli acr efflux knockout strain AG100A(\u0394acr) (Table S2) [13] shows that the loss of acrB reduces the IC50 of ERY to approximately 5% of the wild-type AG100 value but reduces it to just 23% in the case of DOX.\n\nThe model captures others features of the data, particularly that appropriately chosen sequential treatments produce fewer bacteria than the combination, yet some sequential treatments produce more (Fig S18 in S1 Text, section 5).\n\nDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Fig 5.\n\nA mathematical model indicates frequency-dependent selection for the pump duplication can cause a nonreciprocal collateral sensitivity profile with respect to population densities.(A) The first two columns indicate modelled internal drug concentrations in three cell phenotypes (dark blue: \u201cwild-type\u201d cells not expressing the pump; red: the pump gene is expressed; dark grey: two pump genes are expressed).\n\nThe third column shows modelled population densities through time, indicating the frequencies of each phenotype within that density.\n\nThe different drugs select for resistant (pump-expressing) and susceptible (pump-not-expressed) phenotypes at different rates, despite both having been calibrated to equal inhibitory effect (namely IC50) on a population consisting almost exclusively of wild-type cells by the end of day 1.\n\nThese simulations show that monotherapies consisting of either drug select for different population structures, each having different frequencies of the pump gene and its duplication, depending on which drug is being applied.\n\nThus, given n days of adaptation to DOX followed by adaptation to ERY, after the switch, density decreases.\n\n(B) Implementing the (n+1) protocol in the model is consistent with the data of Fig.\n\n4.\n\n(S1 Data contains the data used in this figure.) http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002104.g005A second cross sensitivity property of the ERY\u2014DOX was also established, as follows.\n\nHaving found a mechanism for an NCS with respect to population densities, we hypothesised that the (n+1)-protocol data could exhibit cross sensitivities with respect to other measures of bacterial fitness.\n\nTo demonstrate this, we fitted the logistic growth model to bacterial density time series, where the parameter R is per hour per capita growth rate and K is the population carrying capacity.\n\nThe resulting data exhibits collateral sensitivities irrespective of the order in which the drugs were exchanged because a reduction of R was observed following a change of drug for every n tested (from 3 to 6), although not all reductions were significant (Fig.\n\n6).\n\nDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Fig 6.\n\nA collateral sensitivity at IC70 with respect to per capita growth rate,

and the regression coefficient R2 from exemplar fits are indicated alongside modelled dynamics.\n\n(B) The resulting dataset shows significant and nonsignificant collateral sensitivities with respect to growth rate (R) following an exchange of antibiotic (t tests, n = 5).\n\n(S1 Data contains the data used in this figure.) http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002104.g006 DiscussionDespite the ability of bacteria to adapt to an antibiotic challenge, our laboratory model shows that one can exploit a sensitising property of fluctuating environments to eliminate a bacterium eventually at dosages that only inhibit growth by 70% initially.\n\nHowever, ours is a very simple treatment model inspired by bacterial infections, and we do not wish to overstate its predictive power in relation to the treatment of humans.\n\nIn particular, the loss of slow-growing cells from our microcosm is not representative of the in vivo conditions in which slow-growing, antibiotic-tolerant phenotypes can be responsible for recalcitrance to treatment [32].\n\nOur model is also limited because it lacks an immune response or any of the environmental complexity found in the human body.\n\nThe clinical practise of how antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections begins with the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), the minimal drug concentration at which no visible growth of a bacterium is observed after overnight culture in vitro [33,34].\n\nAfter determining the MIC, antibiotics are deployed at high enough dosages so that peak concentrations are achieved in vivo well in excess of this number [35].\n\nExperience has shown that super-MIC dosages are necessary for successful recovery from infection when using combination treatment and monotherapy [33\u201339], although there is recent evidence of effective lower-dose antifungal, anti-MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), and antimalarial treatments in vivo [40\u201342].\n\nHowever, so few sequential treatments have been trialled in the clinic that there is little accumulated data on or understanding of what dosing or scheduling criteria might be needed when using sequential treatments in vivo.\n\nFurthermore, not all IC70 sequential treatments lead to clearance, and some drug sequences produced higher population densities than the equivalent combination treatment (Fig.\n\n2A).\n\nThe reasons for this are not clear, although both data and the theoretical efflux model do exhibit large between-treatment variation (Fig.\n\n2A, Fig S18 in S1 Text, section 5).\n\nA prior hypothesis states that greater antibiotic heterogeneities in the bacterial environment should diminish the rate of drug-resistance adaptation [43].\n\nThis would mean, for example, that bacteria adapt more readily to an EEEEDDDD treatment (one drug switch) than to EDEDEDED (seven switches).\n\nWe therefore sought a relationship between bacterial population densities and the number of drug switches implemented in different sequential treatments but found no evidence of the predicted correlation (Fig S11 in S1 Text, section 3).\n\nIt is well known that the use of low dosages can select for resistant strains when they are competed in co-culture with susceptible strains [17].\n\nHowever, that mid-dose clearance is still possible has a simple explanation in principle: the antibiotic sequences eventually reduce, and then maintain, Malthusian fitness of the evolving population below zero.\n\nTo examine this in the simplest of theoretical contexts, suppose Bn represents bacterial population density after n rounds of treatment where 1-I, with 0<I<1, is an expected fraction of cells that are not cleared by the treatment but instead lost because of other effects (for example, host immunity) each treatment.\n\nIndeed, granulocyte-mediated clearance has been shown to achieve a two-log10 reduction in bacterial load in a 24 h period using a murine model [44], giving a value of I\u22481/100.\n\nAt any sublethal dosage, whereby exponential population growth (at rate r) occurs between treatments spaced T time units apart (cf.\n\nFig.\n\n1A), it follows for a bacteriostatic antibiotic at a dose of \u201cA units\u201d that Bn+1 = I\u2219Bne(r-A)T.\n\nBacterial clearance is assured when the population decays eventually; this happens when Bn+1/Bn<1, which is equivalent to the condition A>r-(log(I-1))/T.\n\nNote that this value is less than r by an amount that depends on I.\n\nIf we now define an analogy of the MIC as, say, the IC99 in this toy model, which is the antibiotic dose that reduces bacterial growth by 99% after one treatment, the condition on A to achieve IC99 is e(r-A)T<1/100, or A>r+(log 100)/T.\n\nThis value is greater than r and therefore effective therapeutically, but it is not representative of the critical minimal dose needed to clear the bacterium [45].\n\nThe absence of visual eradication overnight in vitro should not, according to this argument, itself be used as a rationale to preclude the practical use of an antibiotic drug.\n\nIndeed, the antifungal azole drugs are used to treat Candida albicans clinically at dosages that do not always eliminate population growth after overnight culture in vitro [45\u201347].\n\nIn our in vitro study, we needed to keep the rate of adaptation low for the above theoretical rationale to work, and only certain sequential treatments were able to do this (Fig.\n\n3A and 3B).\n\nThe requirement for low rates of adaptation likely needs the mutations and physiological changes that arise early during treatment, when population sizes are large, to provide no benefit, or even be deleterious later during treatment and so prevent recovery when population size, and mutational supply, is small.\n\nThere have been clinical successes for one particular sequential treatment: Helicobacter pylori infection has improved eradication rates for a sequential treatment relative to a combination therapy at the same dose [8,9], although geographical variations in successes have been observed and attributed to pathogen strain differences [48].\n\nWe hypothesise that the treatment of other clinical pathogens may be possible using sequential antibiotic treatments.\n\nWe note that low dosing is used to treat some bacterial infections.\n\nThe ability of antibiotics to act as modulators of gene expression at low doses [49] can be exploited, for example when certain drug classes (including macrolides) are used to control the expression of virulence factors in MRSA [50].\n\nMoreover, the use of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics as a low-dose adjuvant is a novel strategy in the treatment of recalcitrant MRSA infection [51,52], even though MRSA is resistant to most of these drugs.\n\nThe \u03b2-lactam does not target the cell directly; rather, it enhances the activity of host peptides that are not antimicrobial per se but which modulate the host immune response [53].\n\nHowever, it is not our intention to advocate for the indiscriminate clinical use of low-dose regimens.\n\nRather, we are claiming that sequential dosing strategies exist for administering antibiotics that are sufficiently potent, and which prevent adaptation enough, to clear a bacterium when the equivalent dose combination treatment fails to do so.\n\nThat this can be done even though the bacterium has a scaleable multidrug resistance mechanism in its chromosome gives us cause to hypothesise that new ways of optimising antibiotic use in vivo can be found by alternating them as part of treatment.\n\nMaterials and Methods Media and Strains We used E.\n\ncoli AG100 (a gift from Stuart B.\n\nLevy) and M9 minimal media (0.2% glucose and 0.1% casamino acids).\n\nStock solutions of DOX and ERY were made from powder stocks (Sigma-Aldrich) at 5 mg/ml in water for DOX and 100 mg/ml in ethanol for ERY and stored at -20\u00b0C.\n\nAll subsequent dilutions were made from these stocks and kept at 4\u00b0C.\n\nBatch Transfer Protocol A microtitre plate reader measured optical densities every 20 min at 600nm as a proxy for population densities in different environments (R2>0.99, Fig S1 in S1 Text, section 1).\n\n96-well plates containing 150 \u03bcLof liquid per well incubated at 30\u00b0C were used to culture bacteria; these were shaken in a linear manner before each measurement was taken.\n\nFor prolonged exposure to antibiotics, inoculating bacteria were taken from one colony and cultured overnight in M9 minimal media (0.2% glucose, 0.1% casamino acids) at 30\u00b0C in a shaker-incubator.\n\nAt the end of each season, a 96-pin replicator sampled the liquid volume, which was then transferred to a new plate containing fresh growth medium and antibiotics; the same environment for each replicate population was maintained.\n\nEvery subsequent transfer was performed using the 96-pin replicator; the volume transferred was approximately 1.5\u03bcL.\n\nOD time series were imported into Matlab R2013b to subtract the background (blank wells containing only medium) and generate all other statistics.\n\nLive Cell Counts No claim is made on the basis of optical density data alone that a zero population density had resulted from treatment.\n\nZero densities were determined by observing an OD value below 10-2 units, whereafter the presence of cells was determined by spot tests.\n\nSerial dilutions were then used to determine live cell numbers in colony-forming units, if any were detected (Fig S15 in S1 Text, section 3).\n\nWGS Data Accession Number Whole-genome

2014.\n\nNext Section Abstract Objectives Despite a strong link between antibiotic use and resistance, and highly variable antibiotic consumption rates across the USA, drivers of differences in consumption rates are not fully understood.\n\nThe objective of this study was to examine how provider density affects antibiotic prescribing rates across socioeconomic groups in the USA.\n\nMethods We aggregated data on all outpatient antibiotic prescriptions filled in retail pharmacies in the USA in 2000 and 2010 from IMS Health into 3436 geographically distinct hospital service areas and combined this with socioeconomic and structural factors that affect antibiotic prescribing from the US Census.\n\nWe then used fixed-effect models to estimate the interaction between poverty and the number of physician offices per capita (i.e. physician density) and the presence of urgent care and retail clinics on antibiotic prescribing rates.\n\nResults We found large geographical variation in prescribing, driven in part by the number of physician offices per capita.\n\nFor an increase of one standard deviation in the number of physician offices per capita there was a 25.9% increase in prescriptions per capita.\n\nHowever, the determinants of the prescription rate were dependent on socioeconomic conditions.\n\nIn poorer areas, clinics substitute for traditional physician offices, reducing the impact of physician density.\n\nIn wealthier areas, clinics increase the effect of physician density on the prescribing rate.\n\nConclusions In areas with higher poverty rates, access to providers drives the prescribing rate.\n\nHowever, in wealthier areas, where access is less of a problem, a higher density of providers and clinics increases the prescribing rate, potentially due to competition.\n\nKey words antibiotic resistance public health pharmacoepidemiology Previous SectionNext Section Introduction Antibiotic resistance is a significant public health challenge and contributes to poor inpatient outcomes.1\u20133 Large differences in the frequency of resistant infections have been noted, both among regions of the USA4,5 and across European countries.6 Variations in antibiotic consumption rates among countries6 and regions of countries7\u201311 offer one possible explanation for variation in resistance.\n\nThe main drivers of geographical variations in antibiotic consumption have been attributed to: (i) socioeconomic differences (e.g. education level,12 financial well-being,9,12,13 access to health insurance,11,14 use of childcare centres15); (ii) structural differences (e.g. physician density,9,13 physician remuneration,13 antibiotic costs and competition9,16); and (iii) cultural differences (e.g. prescribing norms,12 patient demand12).\n\nHealthcare providers, as the only ones that can prescribe antibiotics in the USA, play an important role in antibiotic consumption.\n\nHowever, despite the importance of understanding the role that providers play in driving antibiotic use, and the greater cost-related barriers and lower efficiency of care in the USA vis-\u00e0-vis other countries,17,18 there is only limited research on how provider density, or the number of providers per capita, affects antibiotic prescribing in the USA, particularly across socioeconomic groups.\n\nWe hypothesized that provider density may affect prescribing behaviour through competition to retain patients, as has been seen in some limited studies in other countries.19,20 One potential source of competition for providers is non-traditional prescribing outlets, such as urgent care or retail clinics (areas incorporated into a retail store), where patients can receive medical services; these have been shown to have high rates of antibiotic prescribing.21 These types of establishment, which primarily exist in the USA, are viewed as a competitive threat by physicians' organizations.22 Since increased provider density and urgent and retail clinics are associated with more advantaged areas,23,24 we hypothesized that the presence of clinics would have differential effects on provider prescribing across socioeconomic strata.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section Methods Study data Data on the annual number of dispensed drug prescriptions collected from retail pharmacies in the USA were obtained from IMS Health's Xponent database for the years 2000 and 2010.\n\nIMS data provide the total number of prescriptions dispensed by age at the zip-code level, and have been extensively used in prior studies.14,25\u201327 We aggregated zip-code level data up to 3436 geographically distinct hospital service areas (HSAs), which are collections of zip codes in which residents receive most of their hospitalizations from the hospitals in that area,28 and thus are likely to have providers with similar prescribing norms.\n\nHSAs also allow us to compare areas across time.28 We then calculated the number of prescriptions written per capita in each HSA using population data from the US Census (www.census.gov).\n\nSocioeconomic and structural indicators were obtained from the Census Bureau and were selected based on existing literature of the determinants of antibiotic prescribing.7,9,12,16 Structural variables of interest at the HSA level were population density, number of childcare centres per capita (attendance correlates with antibiotic use15), the number of hospitals per capita (which included hospitals with emergency departments), the number of physician offices per capita and the number of clinics per capita.\n\nSocioeconomic variables included the proportion of the population living in poverty in a given year (census estimate based on income and family size), the population age distribution (percentages of the population under 5 and over 65), race/ethnicity (white, African\u2013American and other), education (percentage of the population that graduated from college) and unemployment.\n\nFor the general population level of health, we included the number of dialysis centres per capita.\n\nInfection level in the population, though not a major driver, has been associated with increased prescriptions as well.12 Because detailed data on infection level for the entire population are not available, we controlled for infection level using the elderly population (who account for \u223c16% of all antibiotic prescriptions) by including the number of Medicare discharges per 1000 Medicare enrollees.28 Geographical differences in climate may affect the prescription rate and thus we included the average temperature difference between January and July (www.noaa.gov).\n\nFinally, because the Census Bureau includes additional healthcare establishments in its clinic classifications (for full definition of the clinics variable see the Supplementary data available at JAC Online), we obtained data from Urgent Care Locations, LLC (www.urgentcarelocations.com) on the locations of urgent care and retail clinics in the USA to use as a robustness check.\n\nTable 1 lists the variables included in the analysis.\n\nView this table: In this window In a new window Table 1.\n\nSocioeconomic indicators across HSAs Statistical analysis Because the US Census only occurs every 10 years, we included data from both 2000 and 2010 in our analyses.\n\nWe used a two-way fixed-effect ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model that accounted for inherent differences in state regulations regarding prescribing as well as differences between years.\n\nOur base model centred on both the number of physician offices and clinics per capita in an HSA, and included the previously described socioeconomic, structural and infection level control variables.\n\nTo further examine the socioeconomic determinants of differences in prescribing, we augmented the model to include a set of interaction terms, which allowed the measurement of the synergistic effect of physician density, poverty and clinics.\n\nThe interaction terms help identify the two mechanisms simultaneously motivating differences in prescription rates across socioeconomic strata: differences in the accessibility of physicians to the local population and differences in the competitive landscape facing physicians.\n\nFor model specification see the Supplementary data available at JAC Online.\n\nFor each regression model, a finer-grained analysis was done on the effect of clinics using only urgent and retail clinic data.\n\nHowever, these additional analyses only included data from 2010 because data for finer-grained analyses were not available for 2000.\n\nTo further distinguish between \u2018access\u2019 and \u2018competition\u2019 effects, we also used quantile regression to estimate effects of the independent variables across the entire distribution of prescriptions (for prescribing rate distribution see Figure S1) using the same model equations.\n\nLastly, we examined the robustness of our results using the density of dialysis centres, which are comparable to clinics in that they are health provision centres that occupy similar physical spaces, are similarly located and hire similar employees, but would lack competition with physicians.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section Results There were large differences in the rates of antibiotic prescribing by HSA (Figure 1 and Figure S2).\n\nThe average rate of prescribing across HSAs was 793 [standard deviation (SD) 382] prescriptions per 1000 people.\n\nWhile there were fewer prescriptions written in 2010 compared with 2000, the patterns of prescribing by HSAs were similar across years (Figure S3).\n\nView larger version: In this window In a new window Download as PowerPoint Slide Figure

the number of childcare centres per capita (1.8% increase per SD); the percentage of the population with a bachelor's degree (12.5% increase per SD); the number of dialysis centres (4.6% increase per SD); the percentage of the population neither white nor African\u2013American (7.9% decrease per SD); unemployment (0.9% decrease per 1 percentage point increase); and rural residence (12% decrease).\n\nThe percentage of the population under age 5 was also strongly correlated, but exhibited a non-linear relationship with respect to prescriptions (Figure S4).\n\nWhile the results from our finer-grained analysis were less precise (larger standard errors) because clinic identification data were only available for 2010, the results were nearly identical to the prior results (Table 2, columns 2 and 3).\n\nView this table: In this window In a new window Table 2.\n\nOLS regression results on dependent variable prescriptions per capita Prescribing differences across socioeconomic strata Our interaction terms help to elucidate how socioeconomic conditions affected the prescribing rate.\n\nWhile the marginal effect of the interaction of variables is identified by the coefficient on the relevant interaction term, the net effect on the baseline prescription rate in any context requires the addition of the relevant coefficients.\n\nFor example, to identify the cumulative effect of physician density in a high-poverty area with a clinic requires summing the physician coefficient, each of the pairwise interactions involving physicians, and the triple interaction term.\n\nWe found that the coefficients for the poverty\u2013physician and poverty\u2013clinic interaction terms were positive and significant, indicating that increases in prescriptions per capita were more strongly correlated to both the number of physician offices per capita and the presence of a clinic in areas with high poverty rates (Table 3, column 1).\n\nHowever, our triple interaction term, which measured the effect of physician offices on poorer areas with clinics, was negatively correlated with prescribing, indicating the per capita prescribing rate was not as strongly correlated with an increasing number of physician offices per capita in poor areas with clinics as in poor areas without clinics.\n\nConversely, our positive clinic\u2013physician interaction term indicates that in non-poor areas the opposite was true: the presence of clinics in a non-poor area increased the correlation between the number of physician offices per capita and the prescribing rate when compared with areas without clinics.\n\nResults from the finer-grained analysis were generally the same (i.e. same signs and similar magnitude, but less precision due to fewer data).\n\nWhile the precision of the interaction with poverty was lessened, the interaction with physician offices was strengthened.\n\nView this table: In this window In a new window Table 3.\n\nOLS regression results on dependent variable prescriptions per capita with interactions Robustness If unobservable factors associated with increasing the number of centres that deliver healthcare outside the hospital were driving our results, they would likely show up as correlations with dialysis centres.\n\nTherefore, we examined the robustness of our results to this assumption by replacing clinics with dialysis centres in our interaction analysis.\n\nWe observed a positive association between dialysis centres and the physician prescribing rate, as would be expected in a sicker population.\n\nHowever, there was no other statistical effect on prescribing.\n\nIn addition, if we included both clinics and dialysis centres in the regression, the clinic effect dominated the effect of dialysis centres (Table S1).\n\nOur quantile regression analysis augmented the described findings, showing that the effect of clinics was different across the prescribing rate distribution.\n\nWhere the prescribing rate was low, a clinic was correlated with a strong and significant positive effect on prescribing; however, as the rate of prescribing increased, the effect of a clinic alone was less strongly associated with prescribing (Figure 2a).\n\nHowever, the effect of the number of physician offices per capita was magnified by the presence of a clinic across the prescribing rate distribution, and this effect was more pronounced in areas with higher prescription rates (Figure 2b).\n\nView larger version: In this window In a new window Download as PowerPoint Slide Figure 2.\n\nQuantile regression plot.\n\n(a) Clinic present indicator variable, dummy variable indicating the presence of clinic(s) in an HSA.\n\nThe presence of a clinic had a positive effect on the lower quantiles, in line with the \u2018access\u2019 hypothesis, and a slight negative effect on the upper quantiles, reflecting the better health of these populations and thus lower prescribing rate.\n\n(b) Clinic\u2013physician interaction shows the effects of competition; the presence of a clinic augmented the rate at which prescriptions increased with the number of physicians; this was most pronounced at the higher end of the distribution, suggesting that it may be the result of competition for patients rather than access to alternative sources of care.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section Discussion In this study we found that both the number of physicians per capita and clinics were significant drivers of the per capita antibiotic prescription rate.\n\nThese results are consistent with the literature showing that increasing physician density drives consumption of healthcare services.29 However, we also found a suggestion that clinics altered the prescribing rate differently in poor and non-poor areas.\n\nThis is not surprising since clinics provide an experience that is generally less expensive and more convenient (more hours, no appointments, less expensive) than physician offices or emergency departments.21,30 Evidence also suggests that a large proportion of their clientele are underserved by the rest of the medical system,31 particularly individuals without insurance.21 Thus, we examined how poverty and clinics interacted to elucidate the different mechanisms driving prescribing rates in different socioeconomic areas.\n\nOur results suggest that, in poor areas, while prescription rates increased with both physician office density and the presence of a clinic, the effect of physician office density was mitigated by the presence of a clinic.\n\nIn other words, these results suggest that adding a clinic or a physician office in a poor area increases prescribing, but once a clinic already exists in an area introducing more physician offices has a limited impact.\n\nThese are the expected results if access is the fundamental issue.\n\nIn higher-income areas, on the other hand, we found that the presence of a clinic augmented physician prescribing.\n\nThis correlation was particularly strong when we only used retail clinics, which are largely concentrated in higher-income areas.24 This suggests that in wealthier areas, which are generally already well served by physicians,23 clinic presence increases the prescribing rate for providers.\n\nThe significant lack of an interaction with poverty also supports the notion that retail clinics were largely affecting prescribing habits in wealthier areas.\n\nOur quantile regression approach also strongly supported this result, showing that this effect was strongest in areas that received the most prescriptions.\n\nThere are two potential reasons for the per capita increase in prescribing in non-poor areas: (i) the probability of prescribing an antibiotic at a visit increases when clinics are introduced; and (ii) prescribing rates are constant per visit, but the presence of a clinic augments the office visit rate.\n\nData from The National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) suggest that while the prescribing rates remain constant across poverty levels, the visit rate to outpatient ambulatory care physician offices is 3.5-fold higher in wealthy areas compared with poor areas (Figure S5).\n\nWhile the greater office visit rate suggests that the primary mechanism driving higher prescribing rates is more office/clinic visits, prior studies have found that increasing physician density increases prescribing rates through efforts to retain patients19 and to maintain good patient relationships.20 In addition, when retail clinics open nearby, physicians may change their operations, including providing increased access to same-day care and extended hours.32 These responses, which are a form of non-price competition, can drive up the office visit rate and by extension the antibiotic prescribing rate.\n\nFurther study in this area is warranted.\n\nWe have rigorously controlled for model specification and possible omissions of contributing factors by using OLS and quantile regression and a robustness check using dialysis centre density, controlling for state and year differences and using carefully selected control variables.\n\nHowever, our analysis is subject to some limitations.\n\nFirst, our results are correlative and not causative and we cannot capture every factor that may affect prescribing behaviour.\n\nSecond, the variables included may not adequately identify all the factors leading to differences in prescribing.\n\nThis is particularly true for cultural factors, which have been shown to vary broadly at the country level,12 but additional analysis is needed to understand whether cultural differences drive variation in prescribing rates in the USA.\n\nLastly, we only had data on the number of physician offices and not the number of providers.\n\nHowever, due to the scale of the analysis (>3400 geographical regions), this is unlikely to vary in any systematic way that would bias the results.\n\nConclusions Our results suggest that in the USA, as in other countries,9,13 an increase in provider density is associated with an increase in per capita antibiotic prescribing.\n\nHowever, we find evidence that, rather than this association being driven by supply-induced demand for prescriptions,9,29 it is due to competition between providers.\n\nTherefore, new intervention campaigns must be broad-based, acknowledging the changing healthcare delivery landscape and emphasizing more local coordination among diverse groups of practitioners.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section Funding This work was supported by The Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study (MIDAS) awarded by the National Institutes of General Medical Sciences at the National Institutes of Health (U54 GM088491) and The Extending the Cure Project funded by a Pioneer Portfolio grant of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.\n\nThe funders had no role in the design and conduct of the study, the collection, management, analysis and interpretation of the data, or the preparation, review and approval of the manuscript.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section Transparency declarations None to declare.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section Disclaimer The statements, findings, conclusions, views and opinions contained and expressed in this article are based in part on data obtained under license from the following IMS Health Incorporated information service(s): Xponent\u2122 (2000\u20132010), IMS Health Incorporated.\n\nAll Rights Reserved.\n\nThe statements, findings, conclusions, views and opinions contained and expressed herein are not necessarily those of IMS Health Incorporated or any of its affiliated or subsidiary entities.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section Supplementary data Supplementary data, including Figures S1 to S5 and Table S1, are available at JAC Online (http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/).\n\n\u00a9 The Author 2015.\n\nPublished by Oxford University Press on behalf of the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy.\n\nAll rights reserved.\n\nFor Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com Previous Section References \u21b5 Andersson DI, Hughes D .\n\nAntibiotic resistance and its cost: is it possible to reverse resistance?\n\nNat Rev Microbiol 2010;

Methods Clinical This was a nested cohort prospective multicenter observational pharmacokinetic study within a large randomized controlled trial of CRRT intensity (trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00221013, registered 14 September 2005) [13].\n\nInclusion criteria for this study, known as the Randomized Evaluation of Normal vs.\n\nAugmented Level of CRRT (RENAL) study, have been previously published and are outlined in the online supplement (Additional file 1).\n\nIn brief, patients were randomly assigned to receive post-dilutional hemodiafiltration as either a higher (40 mL/kg body weight/hour effluent flow rate) or lower (25 mL/kg body weight/hour effluent flow rate) intensity rate using equal size filters with polyacrylonitrile membranes.\n\nBy protocol, the target prescribed effluent flow was achieved through an equal contribution of dialysate flow and ultrafiltration.\n\nBlood flow was 200 mL/minute for all study patients except two (150 or 180 mL/minute).\n\nFour hospitals in three separate geographical regions participated in this study.\n\nInstitutional review boards approved the study, and informed consent and demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were obtained [13]; see the online supplement (Additional file 1) for more details.\n\nPharmacokinetic sampling occurred at three time points each day: (1) immediately before antibiotic dosing, (2) after completion of their intravenous infusion, and (3) at 4 hours after completion of infusion.\n\nA patient could participate on more than one occasion but on different days.\n\nThe time of sampling was recorded exactly, and at each time point, a pre-filter blood sample and CRRT effluent sample were obtained simultaneously.\n\nPlasma was separated by centrifugation, immediately frozen, and stored at \u221270\u00b0C until analysis.\n\nLaboratory techniques The plasma and effluent concentrations of ciprofloxacin (molecular weight (MW) 331.3), meropenem (MW 383.5), piperacillin (MW 517.6), and tazobactam (MW 300.3) were determined by using a validated liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry method that has been described previously [9]; see online supplement (Additional file 1) for more details.\n\nThe plasma concentrations of vancomycin (MW 1449.3), urea (MW 60.1), and creatinine (MW 113.1) were determined by using commercial assays by the Chemical Pathology Laboratory, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Queensland Health Scientific and Forensic Services, Brisbane, Australia.\n\nPharmacokinetic calculations The antibiotic CL from hemodiafiltration (CLHDF) was calculated at each time point on the basis of drug recovery in the CRRT effluent by using a standard formula [8,14]:$$ {\\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{L}}_{\\mathrm{HDF}} = \\kern0.37em \\left({\\mathrm{C}}_{\\mathrm{E}}/\\;{\\mathrm{C}}_{\\mathrm{P}}\\right)\\times {\\mathrm{Q}}_{\\mathrm{E}}, $$where CE is the solute concentration in CRRT effluent, QE the prescribed CRRT effluent flow, and CP the solute concentration in plasma.\n\nThe CE/CP ratio is referred to as effluent or dialysate saturation [14] or the saturation coefficient (Sd) [8].\n\nThe Sd is the diafiltration equivalent of sieving coefficient, which is calculated in the same way during hemofiltration.\n\nThe Sd was also calculated for urea and creatinine as a measure of filter membrane function.\n\nUsing pre-filter plasma concentrations at the three time points, the systemic CL (CLs) and Vd were calculated.\n\nThese time points were chosen so that the first and second points related to Vd and the second and third related to CLs. The antibiotic plasma concentration-time data were fitted to one-, two-, or three-compartment models by non-linear mixed-effects population modelling (NONMEM software version 6.1; GloboMax LLC, Hanover, MD, USA) [15].\n\nA Digital Fortran compiler was used, and runs were executed by using Wings for NONMEM (WFN) version 616.\n\nData were analyzed by using the first-order conditional estimation method with interaction.\n\nBetween-subject variability was calculated by using an exponential variability model.\n\nResidual unexplained variability was tested by using exponential or additive random error or both.\n\nVisual inspection of diagnostic scatter plots and the NONMEM objective function value (OFV) were used to evaluate goodness of fit.\n\nStatistical comparison of nested models was undertaken in the NONMEM program on the basis of a chi-square test of the difference in OFV.\n\nA decrease in the OFV of 3.84 units (P <0.05) was considered statistically significant.\n\nThe influence of the properties of a given antibiotic was assessed by using meropenem and vancomycin because they were the most commonly used antibiotics in this series and differed in terms of size (MW 438 versus 1,486 Daltons, respectively) and protein binding (less than 10% versus 30%, respectively [6]).\n\nThe systemic elimination half-life (T1/2) was calculated as follows:$$ {\\mathrm{T}}_{1/2} = \\kern0.37em \\left(0.693\\times \\mathrm{V}\\mathrm{d}\\right)/{\\mathrm{CL}}_{\\mathrm{s}} $$ The proportion of CLs attributed to hemodiafiltration was calculated by:$$ \\%\\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{L}\\kern0.37em =\\kern0.37em \\left({\\mathrm{CL}}_{\\mathrm{HDF}}/{\\mathrm{CL}}_{\\mathrm{s}}\\right)\\times 100.\n\n$$ In the case of CLHDF being determined on multiple occasions in the same patient during the time period when CLs was calculated, %CL was determined by using the mean CLHDF.\n\nStatistical calculations Statistical analyses were conducted according to the normality of data which was determined by using the D\u2019Agostino and Pearson omnibus normality test.\n\nNon-parametric data were subject to the Mann-Whitney and Spearman r correlation tests, whereas parametric data were compared by using the Student t test (with Welch\u2019s correction when variances were not equal) and Pearson r correlation test.\n\nThe goodness of fit (r2) of statistically significant correlations was determined by using linear regression.\n\nAll regressions and statistics were conducted by using GraphPad Prism version 5.03 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA), and a P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nResultsSampling occurred at 179 time points in 24 patients: ciprofloxacin (19), meropenem (65), piperacillin-tazobactam (29), and vancomycin (66).\n\nThe demographics, baseline clinical characteristics, and other treatments for the 24 study patients have been presented previously [9].\n\nBriefly, mean age \u00b1 standard deviation was 62 \u00b1 17 years, most were men (16:8), and mean weight was 82 \u00b1 17 kg.\n\nThirteen patients were diagnosed with sepsis, and edema was present in 12 patients.\n\nAdmission APACHE (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) III and SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) scores were 103 \u00b1 17 and 11.0 \u00b1 3.0, respectively.\n\nVentilatory support was required in 75% of patients, and 90-day mortality was 42%.\n\nThe serum creatinine concentration at randomization was 273 \u00b1 123 \u03bcmol/L, and oligo-anuria was present in eight patients.\n\nThe prescribed effluent flow rates in the higher- and lower-intensity groups were a median (interquartile range, IQR) of 2,800 (2,600 to 3,100) mL/hour and 2,130 (2,000 to 2,375) mL/hour, respectively (P <0.0001).\n\nExtracorporeal antibiotic removal The antibiotic pre-filter plasma concentration correlated with the CRRT effluent concentration for each of the antibiotics (online supplement Figure S1; see Additional file 1), and Sd was less than 1.0 in 94% of samples.\n\nThe influence of CRRT intensity on antibiotic CLHDF is shown in Table

or IQRs were noted in each case (Table 1).\n\nA correlation was noted between the prescribed effluent flow rate and CLHDF for vancomycin but not for other antibiotics (online supplement Figure S2; see

plasma concentrations of piperacillin to tazobactam was 14.9 (IQR 10.7 to 23.2, range 7.5 to 41.7).\n\nThe Sd of vancomycin and meropenem was not consistently influenced by the albumin concentration

in the case of meropenem, in which an approximate dose-response relationship is observed, but despite a twofold difference in dose, the concentration-time curves are not clearly separated (Figure 3).\n\nFigure 3 Marked inter-individual and inter-occasion variability in the plasma concentration-time profile of meropenem over 12 hours following 17 doses of either 500 or 1,000 mg to 12

distribution for each occasion (performed by using GraphPad Prism version 4.03 for Windows; GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).\n\nIn the case of vancomycin and meropenem, the prescribed CRRT effluent rate did not significantly influence CLs (online supplement Figure S7; Additional file 1), Vd, or elimination half-life (data not shown).\n\nRelationship between systemic and extracorporeal clearance The contribution of CLHDF to the calculated CLs also varied widely.\n\nThe medians and IQRs were ciprofloxacin 32% (29% to 34%), meropenem 66% (42% to 76%), piperacillin 23% (19% to 27%), tazobactam 49% (39% to 57%), and vancomycin 92% (84% to 109%).\n\nInter-occasional pharmacokinetic variability The concentration-time profile, clinical information, and pharmacokinetic parameters for two of the patients who provided samples on multiple days are shown in Figure 4.\n\nMuch day-to-day variability in antibiotic pharmacokinetics was noted, although each patient received a fixed dosage of CRRT.\n\nFigure 4 Examples of inter-occasion variability in antibiotic pharmacokinetics.\n\n(a) Admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) after coronary artery bypass grafts and valve repair, requiring mechanical ventilation and vasopressors for hypotension (not attributed to sepsis).\n\nThis patient received higher-intensity continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and did not survive

a soft tissue infection, complicated by edema and hypoalbuminemia (24 g/L).\n\nTreatment included mechanical ventilation, antibiotics, and dopamine infusion (decreasing requirements during admission, not required at the time of second samples).\n\nThis patient received higher-intensity CRRT and was alive at 90 days post-admission.\n\nCiprofloxacin (200 mg) was administered on both occasions.\n\nCL, clearance; Vd, volume of distribution.\n\nDiscussion Key findings In this multicenter pharmacokinetic study of four antibiotics and tazobactam, the prescribed intensity of CRRT did not adequately predict CLHDF or Sd, CLs, Vd, or half-life.\n\nThis did not appear to be explained by the age of the filter, hematocrit, or serum albumin concentration.\n\nA correlation was noted between antibiotic concentration in the effluent and pre-filter plasma samples, where the effluent concentration was lower than that of plasma.\n\nUsing urea and creatinine as biomarkers of membrane function, despite a correlation between effluent flow and CLHDF, we detected failure of equilibration between dialysate and plasma during higher CRRT intensity.\n\nThe correlation between the Sd of urea or creatinine with antibiotics was inconsistent, limiting their role as a surrogate measures for clearance.\n\nPrinciples of extracorporeal solute removal The influence of components of the prescription of an extracorporeal treatment was recently reviewed [38].\n\nIn the context of CRRT, effluent flow is the rate-limiting step because it is slower than blood flow, so clearance is anticipated to positively correlate with effluent flow rate.\n\nFurthermore, clearance by convection is dose-dependent and this is the most efficient method of removing larger molecules.\n\nSmaller molecules are also removed efficiently by diffusion; however, the effect of diffusion is non-linear at higher effluent flow rates and this may compromise clearance.\n\nPost-filter replacement maximizes removal but this may be at the expense of the life of the filter [39].\n\nOur results suggest that these simple and logical relationships may not be observed in clinical practice.\n\nIn particular, in our study, the effect of prescribed CRRT effluent flow rate on antibiotic clearance was not consistently dose-dependent.\n\nOthers have reported similar findings, including a higher Sd for beta-2 microglobulin (MW 11,000) with increasing ultrafiltration rates, and have observed that varying the proportion of dialysate and ultrafiltrate flows in hemodiafiltration influences the Sd of different solutes variably [40].\n\nFactors that may interfere with extracorporeal solute removal A correlation was noted between CLHDF and effluent flow for vancomycin, creatinine, and urea but not for other antibiotics.\n\nThese observations, coupled with the decrease in the Sd of urea with increasing effluent flow, indicate that equilibration across the filter is unpredictable and may decrease at higher effluent flow rates.\n\nThis implies a dynamic but unpredictable loss of filter membrane function with use and this loss may be due to partial filter clotting or membrane fouling due to higher transmembrane pressures [41,42].\n\nSmaller molecules may be more affected by this process because their clearance is diffusion-dependent [40].\n\nThe age of the filter probably failed to have an influence in our study because of selection bias (filters that are better functioning and less prone to clotting will last longer).\n\nFinally, even in laboratory-based testing of dialyzers, there is marked scatter of these data because of any of the above-mentioned factors and changes in transit time due to the effect of internal and back filtration of solutes or water or both [43].\n\nAdsorption of antibiotic to the filter may also contribute to the results observed.\n\nInfluence of continuous renal replacement therapy on clearances The extracorporeal antibiotic and tazobactam CLs observed are consistent with data in the literature [12]; however, we also noted a wide dispersion of results within a single CRRT treatment arm.\n\nThis had the effect of reducing the clinical and statistical significance of the relatively small differences in concentration that were observed between groups.\n\nThe reason for this variability requires further investigation and may include differences in renal (and residual function in patients with AKI) and non-renal clearance mechanisms.\n\nThe CRRT regimen used in this study was that of hemodiafiltration.\n\nIn both types of CRRT, only the free (unbound) antibiotic can be cleared.\n\nThe antibiotics assessed in this study are minimally protein-bound [44]: ciprofloxacin 30% to 40%, meropenem 8%, piperacillin 20-30%, vancomycin 30% to 40%, and tazobactam 20% to 30% (although these values may change in critical illness [26]); so vancomycin CL is predicted to be less than meropenem.\n\nDifferences in MW can also influence CL in certain CRRT regimens.\n\nFor example, the partial diffusive CL used in continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration will only achieve less vancomycin removal than meropenem; however, we noted inconsistencies in this simple assumption, and possible reasons were discussed above.\n\nRelationship to previous studies We observed both inter-individual and inter-occasion (intra-individual) variability in pharmacokinetics.\n\nSome variability may depend on the clinical characteristics of patients.\n\nFor example, in sepsis and critical illness, ciprofloxacin CL and Vd are decreased compared with volunteers matched for creatinine CL and weight [18].\n\nSimilarly, the Vd and CL of meropenem are lower in critically ill patients with sepsis compared with those with multitrauma, matched for creatinine CL [22].\n\nFinally, the calculated CL and Vd for piperacillin is lower after multiple doses administered (similar to the context of our data [9]) compared with a single dose [31].\n\nDynamic changes in residual renal function may specifically contribute to these observations.\n\nObservations with piperacillin and tazobactam Piperacillin and tazobactam are co-formulated, and so assessment of their individual pharmacokinetics may inform dosage recommendations.\n\nBetween-subject variation in pharmacokinetics was observed (Table 2), but with tazobactam there was little variability in the weight-normalized Vd of tazobactam.\n\nThis suggests that its Vd was influenced primarily by body weight rather than the pathophysiology of critical illness.\n\nThe CL and Vd of tazobactam were higher than those of piperacillin.\n\nSome studies have shown a similar relationship [28,30] but others have not [29].\n\nSome studies have quantified piperacillin pharmacokinetics and extrapolated these directly to those of tazobactam [10,21], but this appears to be reliable.\n\nWe noted marked variability in the ratio of piperacillin to tazobactam plasma concentrations as reported by others [28].\n\nContribution of extracorporeal clearance to the total antibiotic clearance Systemic CL and elimination half-life did not differ according to CRRT dose, and so the CRRT prescription may not be useful for guiding antibiotic prescribing.\n\nThis has been observed previously [10,22,26].\n\nThere is significant non-renal clearance of vancomycin early in the course of AKI, but this decreases with time [45], which may also contribute to the poor relationship.\n\nThe contribution of extracorporeal CL to systemic CL was variable.\n\nThis related to the combined effect of the variability in extracorporeal CL and inter-individual and inter-occasion (despite identical CRRT regimens) variability in systemic pharmacokinetics.\n\nIn many cases, extracorporeal CL accounted for more than 30% of the observed systemic CL for that antibiotic, which is a suggested threshold for adjustment of the dosing regimen.\n\nSuch variability in CL limits attempts to develop dosing guidelines.\n\nOf note, CLHDF appeared to exceed CLs in some cases.\n\nThe reason for this is not apparent from our data but may relate to an error with either of these calculated values.\n\nFor example, it has been noted that the delivered effluent flow rate is frequently lower than the prescribed flow rate, and so the calculation of clearance based on the prescribed effluent rate may overstate the actual clearance [41].\n\nStrengths and limitations We evaluated the pharmacokinetics of multiple clinically relevant antibiotics administered to patients as part of a prospective multicenter observational study within a large randomized controlled trial.\n\nMultiple measurements were obtained, and similarities were observed between our data and the literature.\n\nOur data, however, greatly expand our understanding of CL, Vd, and pharmacokinetics in the setting of CRRT treatment using different CRRT doses and the advantages of randomization and multiple sampling.\n\nAlthough median extracorporeal CL values were consistent with the literature, the degree of variability was an unexpected finding.\n\nAll care was taken with the collection of samples by designated staff, subsequent storage, and then analysis using validated methods.\n\nHowever, we cannot exclude that this reflected unmeasured or unknown clinical or mechanical factors occurring during CRRT (for example, an undetected machine error at the time of sampling or a difference between the prescribed and delivered effluent flow rate); however, this also reflects clinical reality.\n\nThe impact of these factors may have been reduced if clearance was determined from a prolonged collection (over hours) rather than at a point in time, as used in our study.\n\nOur study might be underpowered to detect a true difference in clearance on the basis of CRRT intensity, relating in part, to the selection of patients.\n\nThe dose ratio of lower- to higher-intensity CRRT effluent is 0.60 per protocol, but in this study the ratio was 0.76 based on the achieved median effluent flow rates.\n\nThis may narrow the difference between the two groups, although this effect would be lessened by analysis in terms of the actual effluent production rate as performed here rather than according to milliliters per kilogram.\n\nConclusionsWe have identified marked variability in systemic CL and Vd of multiple antibiotics in critically ill patients with AKI and also the variable influence of CRRT regimen on extracorporeal CL.\n\nTaken together, such variability complicates empiric antibiotic prescribing during CRRT.\n\nOngoing research to further explore what factors contribute to this variability is important.\n\nIn the meantime, drug monitoring may be the most practical method for ensuring that antibiotic therapeutic targets are achieved in critically ill patients receiving CRRT.\n\nKey messages In this multicenter pharmacokinetic study, the prescribed intensity of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) did not adequately predict solute clearance, volume of distribution, half-life, or the saturation coefficient.\n\nThis did not appear to be explained by the age of the filter, hematocrit, or serum albumin concentration.\n\nUsing urea and creatinine as biomarkers of membrane function, despite a correlation between effluent flow and clearance from hemodiafiltration (CLHDF), we detected failure of equilibration between dialysate and plasma during higher CRRT intensity.\n\nThe correlation between the saturation coefficient of urea or creatinine with antibiotics was inconsistent, limiting their role as a surrogate measures for clearance.\n\nThis variable pharmacokinetics complicates empiric antibiotic prescribing during CRRT, and ongoing research is required to determine factors that contribute to this variability.\n\nIn the meantime, drug monitoring may be the most practical method for ensuring that antibiotic therapeutic targets are achieved in critically ill patients receiving CRRT.\n\nAbbreviations AKI: acute kidney injury CE : solute concentration in continuous renal replacement therapy effluent CL: clearance CLHDF

71.1% (69/97) had a significant growth on culture, and >80% of these were Escherichia coli (20.9% produced extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL)).\n\nPositive urine dipstick (leucocyte esterase \u22651 and/or nitrate positive) compared against positive microscopy (white blood cell >10/HPF, bacteria \u22651/HPF, epithelial cells <5/HPF) had a higher sensitivity (99% vs.\n\n57%) but a lower specificity (47% vs.\n\n89%), respectively.\n\nCombined POCT resulted in the best sensitivity (98%) and specificity (81%).\n\nNearly one in ten patients received an antimicrobial to which the organism was not fully sensitive.ConclusionOne rapid, cost-effective POCT was too inaccurate to be used alone by healthcare workers, impeding antibiotic stewardship in a high ESBL setting.\n\nAppropriate prescribing is improved with concurrent use and concordant results of urine dipstick and microscopy.ObjectifLa litt\u00e9rature publi\u00e9e provenant des r\u00e9gions \u00e0 ressources limit\u00e9es est rare, bien que les infections des voies urinaires (IVU) soient une cause fr\u00e9quente de pr\u00e9sentation ambulatoire et d'utilisation d'antibiotiques.\n\nL'interpr\u00e9tation des tests au point des soins (TPS) est li\u00e9e \u00e0 l'utilisation d'antibiotiques et \u00e0 la r\u00e9sistance aux antibiotiques.\n\nNous avons cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9valuer la pr\u00e9cision diagnostique des TPS et leur r\u00f4le dans la prise en charge antibiotiques des IVU.M\u00e9thodesAnalyse r\u00e9trospective sur un an dans trois cliniques \u00e0 la fronti\u00e8re entre la Tha\u00eflande et le Myanmar sur des adultes non enceintes avec des sympt\u00f4mes urinaires.\n\nLes TPS (bandelettes urinaires et microscopie) ont \u00e9t\u00e9 compar\u00e9s \u00e0 la culture avec une croissance significative, class\u00e9e comme croissance pure d'un organisme unique >105 cfu/mL.R\u00e9sultatsChez 247 patients, 82,6% de femmes, les sympt\u00f4mes les plus fr\u00e9quents \u00e9taient la dysurie (81.2%), la douleur suspubienne (67.8%) et la fr\u00e9quence urinaire (53.7%).\n\nApr\u00e8s exclusion des \u00e9chantillons contamin\u00e9s, les IVU ont \u00e9t\u00e9 diagnostiqu\u00e9es chez 52.4% (97/185);

methodsResultsDiscussionLimitationsConclusionAcknowledgementsReferencesSupporting InformationIn view of increasing antibiotic resistance in low-income countries [1-3], efficient, economic and effective diagnostic and treatment strategies [4] are required for urinary tract infections (UTI), one of the most common reasons for adult outpatient attendance and antibiotic prescription [5].\n\nThe WHO Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance 2014 report illustrated the presence of limited data in South-East Asia and described the situation as a \u2018burgeoning and often neglected problem\u2019 [6, 7].\n\nIn South-East Asia, extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL) rates are amongst the highest reported [8] and unrestricted antibiotic use and polypharmacy are rife [9].\n\nThe roll out of rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) and artemisinin combination therapy for malaria have also revealed the millions of cases of fever misdiagnosed in tropical countries [10].\n\nAccurate discriminating diagnostic testing and structured diagnostic pathways for prescribing in non-malaria fevers need to be developed [11].A Cochrane review emphasises point-of-care tests (POCT) to allow informed antibiotic prescribing [12].\n\nClinical features and POCT including urine dipstick and urine microscopy allow empiric treatment to be commenced before urine culture results are available.\n\nOverdiagnosis from this approach is accepted as delaying antibiotics by more than 48 h, whilst waiting for the culture results, is much more likely to have poor symptom control, emphasising the importance of obtaining a rapid decision [13].History alone has a diagnostic sensitivity between 50% and 80%, and multiple algorithms used in different studies have made clinical assessment of UTI difficult to compare [14].\n\nClinical examination is not useful in diagnosing UTI [15] as opposed to pyelonephritis.\n\nUrine dipstick is routine practice in many countries for initially investigating a UTI and a meta-analysis (of 70 publications) concluded that a urine dipstick that was negative for both nitrites and leucocyte esterase was useful in all populations to exclude the presence of infection [16].\n\nThe sensitivities of positive leucocyte esterase and/or nitrites ranged from 68% to 88% in different patient groups and indicated that positive results have to be confirmed [16].\n\nWhen positivity of urine dipstick was defined as the presence of nitrites or leucocyte esterase and blood, the sensitivity and specificity were 77% and 70% respectively and NPV 65% [17].\n\nUnfortunately, few conclusions have been drawn on the validity of urine microscopy.\n\nIts use seems to offer little added value to diagnosis based on history and dipstick [18].\n\nUrine culture for the detection and quantification of the pathogen and sensitivities from a mid-stream urine (MSU) sample in the presence of clinical symptoms remains the UTI diagnostic gold standard [16].The clinical decision-making of primary healthcare workers in rural and remote areas is rarely assessed, particularly in regard to interpretation of the POCT [10, 19].\n\nAs a remote example, due to paucity of published data, healthcare workers in Blantyre, Malawi correctly adhered to treatment of positive microscopy and RDT results for malaria, but also rarely withheld treatment in the setting of a negative result: 58% of patients with a negative RDT still received antimalarials [19].\n\nIn fact, in rural and remote parts of Asia, the main uncertainty for malaria-orientated primary healthcare workers is how to diagnose and treat non-malaria febrile patients [11].\n\nAn evaluation of prevalence in Panamanian women showed UTI was diagnosed in 29.8%, but only 21.15% met evidence-based criteria, although this was not compared to urine culture [20].Shoklo Malaria Research Unit (SMRU) has established clinics attended by remote populations scattered along the Thailand\u2013Myanmar border that provide basic care but easy access to diagnosis and treatment of malaria by microscopy or rapid detection tests [21].\n\nSignificant gains in control of malaria in the area and reductions in the numbers of positive cases have thrown the spotlight on diagnosis and treatment of non-malaria diagnoses including UTI [22, 23].In view of these issues, we aimed to conduct a one-year retrospective analysis of non-pregnant adult patients presenting with urinary symptoms to assess diagnostic accuracy of POCT, and their role in improving urinary tract infection antibiotic prescribing in remote clinics.Materials and methodsTop of pageAbstractIntroductionMaterials and methodsResultsDiscussionLimitationsConclusionAcknowledgementsReferencesSupporting InformationSite and populationSMRU clinics are situated in Tak province, Thailand, adjacent to the Thailand\u2013Myanmar border.\n\nThere are two sites for migrants at Wangpha (WPA) and Mawker Thai (MKT) villages with a combined estimated population of 50 000\u2013150 000 (mobile nature of the population makes it impossible to provide a single figure) and a further clinic in Maela Refugee Camp (MLA) with a population of 43 641 in June 2014 (www.theborderconsortium.org).\n\nFree health care to marginalised people from both sides of the border with outpatient and antenatal departments, and limited inpatient facilities are provided.\n\nThe clinics\u2019 case mix includes a variety of tropical infections, for example malaria, typhoid, rickettsial infections, dengue and other communicable and non-communicable diseases.\n\nThere is no schistosomiasis reported in this area.\n\nThere are limited on-site laboratory facilities which undertake microscopy for malaria blood smears, urine and faecal specimens.\n\nSince SMRU was established in 1986, urinary microscopy was, for many years, the only laboratory support for UTI diagnosis.\n\nUrine dipsticks became available in 2006 and urine culture in 2011.Patients are able to access drugs through a variety of means.\n\nThis includes non-profit organisations such as SMRU, Thai public services (although payment and transportation via checkpoints is required), or in shops and pharmacies on both sides of the border, where villagers can purchase packets without medical assessment [9].\n\nThese packets are known locally as yaa chud and consist of a mix of four to five tablets, of which 20% contain antibiotics according to mass and atomic spectrometry [9].\n\nUnpublished data from a survey suggested 25% of pregnant women had antimicrobial activity in their urine [24].The healthcare providers are local staffs who have completed at least one-year training to be competent at assessment and treatment of common diseases.\n\nIn addition, they have support from qualified doctors.Predominantly of Karen and Burman ethnicity, Carrara et al.\n\nreported a literacy rate amongst 2424 pregnant women of 47% in 2011 [25].\n\nA glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD) prevalence of 7\u201315% [26] affects antibiotics that can be prescribed.\n\nRemoteness and culture have maintained a very low rate of sexually transmitted infections (STI) for syphilis and HIV [27].For this primary evaluation of diagnosis and management of UTI, all microbiological data of first episodes of non-pregnant patients, 18 years and older, who attended an outpatient department from November 2013 to October 2014 with symptoms suggestive of a UTI (at least one of dysuria, frequency or flank pain), were reviewed.Clinical assessment and sample collectionIn September and October 2013, healthcare workers were provided with a refresher course on urine samples.\n\nThis included information on how to inform patients to obtain a clean MSU sample and for staff to accurately read a urine dipstick and handle and store a sample on site, prior to transportation for culture at the central laboratory of SMRU in Mae Sot, 30\u201360 km from the field sites.\n\nInformation was made available in local languages to standardise the diagnostic procedures at all sites.A single MSU sample was taken for all patients.\n\nThe same sample was analysed using a rapid urine dipstick and urine microscopy in the field laboratory and stored in the fridge at 2\u20138 \u00b0C and transported to Mae Sot for urine culture.\n\nThe speed of transportation depended on the day of the week with more than 85% of samples being collected and plated on the same day and the remainder being completed within two days.\n\nData on demographics, clinical features, history of antibiotic use (last 14 days), diagnosis, initial management, dipstick, microscopy and culture results were extracted from the microbiology database.Laboratory proceduresROCHE Combur-10-test UV/M\u00ae dipstick tests were performed following the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nIn brief, they were immersed in urine, laid flat and read after 60 s by a healthcare worker.\n\nData for pH, protein, red blood cells (RBC), haemoglobin, ketones, leucocyte esterase and nitrites were available.Urine microscopy was undertaken by trained staff in the field laboratory using a Hettick bench centrifuge EBA model 20.\n\nA urine volume of 10 ml was centrifuged at 800 g for 5 min.\n\nAfter removal of the supernatant, a drop of the mixed sediment was applied to a glass slide followed by a cover slip and was examined using light microscopy for 10 high-powered fields (HPF; \u00d740 objective).\n\nThe total counts of white blood cells (WBC), RBC, bacteria, epithelial cells, crystals (uric acid, oxalate and phosphate), casts (granular, RBC), yeast and trichomonas were divided by 10 to obtain the average per HPF.\n\nBacteria were categorised as 1 + (1\u201310 bacteria/HPF), 2 + (11\u2013100 bacteria/HPF) or 3 + (>100 bacteria/HPF) [28].\n\nAn open comment box was available for additional findings.\n\nThe test was considered positive if WBC \u226510/HPF and bacteria \u22651/HPF, and a contaminated sample was classified as epithelial cells \u22655/HPF.\n\nIn case of a contaminated sample, MSU was recollected for urine microscopy, dipstick and culture, if possible.Urine culture was undertaken at the central microbiological facility in Mae Sot by trained staff.\n\nA sterile loop was used to inoculate 0.001 ml urine onto UTI chromogenic media (Oxoid Brilliance\u2122 UTI Clarity\u2122 agar, Basingstoke, Hampshire, United Kingdom) and incubated overnight in air at 35 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C.\n\nThe number of colony-forming units (CFU) of each colony type was counted and categorised as follows: <104, 104\u2013105 and >105 CFU/ml.\n\nSignificant growth was classified as growth of a single organism at >105 CFU/ml.\n\nNo significant growth was classified as a single organisms at <104 CFU/ml or two organisms at <105 CFU/ml.\n\nCultures growing three or more organisms were reported as mixed growth of greater than two organisms.\n\nFor the analysis of POCT growth of a single organism at 104\u2013105 CFU/ml, mixed growth of two organisms with one or both organisms at >105 CFU/ml and known contaminants were excluded for analysis.\n\nAll significant organisms were identified and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed, where appropriate, using standard operating procedures.\n\nESBL testing was undertaken for E.\n\ncoli and Klebsiella sp.\n\nisolates.\n\nResults were recorded and reported, using the in-house Microbiology Microsoft Access 2010 database.DiagnosisIn practice, healthcare workers utilised the 2007 Burmese Border Guidelines for patients presenting with urinary tract symptoms [29].\n\nThis guideline, adapted from the M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res guidelines, recommends the use of history taking, physical examination and POCT to diagnose patients with urinary tract symptoms without fever as urinary tract infection and with fever and flank pain as pyelonephritis.TreatmentThe antibiotic repertoire for treatment of UTI in the field clinics is limited [30].\n\nFor females, treatment for uncomplicated UTI is oral nitrofurantoin 100 mg QID for 3 days; for males, it is oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg BID for 7 days.\n\nG6PD status is checked before giving nitrofurantoin.\n\nPatients diagnosed with pyelonephritis are admitted and given oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg BID or IV ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg OD if oral intake is intolerable.Follow-upRoutinely, if the patient was admitted, antibiotics were changed according to the organism and the susceptibility profiles.\n\nThis information was normally available 48\u201372 h post-sample receipt.\n\nNo consistent routine follow-up was arranged for outpatients, unless an ESBL-producing bacterium or a bacterium resistant to the prescribed antibiotic was isolated.\n\nIn both cases, an attempt to contact the patient either through phone calls or through a home visit was made in order to change the antibiotics.\n\nThis was not always possible due to difficulties in knowing the exact address or living in areas that were difficult or unsafe to reach.\n\nAll patients were advised to come back if their symptoms were not improving.Statistical analysisThe analysis was undertaken using IBM SPSS Statistics 22 for Windows.\n\nThe mean was calculated for continuous normally distributed data and the median for non-normally distributed data.\n\nTwo-way tables were used to obtain sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive values for different diagnostic approaches and cut-offs.\n\nThe diagnostics odds ratio (DOR) that represents the ratio of the odds of a positive test result in the diseased group, i.e significant culture, to the odds of a positive test in the non-diseased group, i.e negative or non-significant culture, was calculated using the following formula: [16] The specimens with contaminated culture and/or urine microscopy were reported but excluded from analysis.EthicsRetrospective review of outpatient records was approved by the Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee and by the local Tak Province Community Ethics Advisory Board.\n\nAll data were anonymised.ResultsTop of pageAbstractIntroductionMaterials and methodsResultsDiscussionLimitationsConclusionAcknowledgementsReferencesSupporting InformationGeneral demographicsIn one year, November 2013 to October 2014, records were reviewed for 247 non-pregnant patients, 18 years or above with urinary tract symptoms.\n\nThe median (range) age was 34 (18\u201378) years, and 82.6% (204/247) of patients were

nitrite in 21.2% (51/241); positive nitrites with negative leucocytes in 3.3% (8/241); and proteinuria in 41.5% (100/241), haematuria in 32.0% (77/241) and ketones in 9.5% (23/241).There were 7/247 (2.8%) samples with five or more epithelial cells which were excluded from further analysis due to contamination.\n\nThere were 36.7% (88/240) of urine microscopy examinations that fulfilled the criteria for positivity (WBC \u226510, epithelial cells <5, bacteria \u22651), including 23.1% (9/39) of males.\n\nCrystals were present in 55.4% (133/240) of patients, most of whom had one crystal type reported 91.0% (121/133), with two and three types reported in 11 and one patient, respectively.\n\nThe predominant crystal type was uric acid detected in 91.7% (122/133).\n\nRBC casts were present in one patient 0.4% (1/240), and WBC casts were present in two patients 0.8% (2/240).\n\nIn the 197 female patients, 1.7% (4/240) had yeast and 0.4% (1/240) had trichomonas, but not identified in any males.A urine culture result was not available for one patient.\n\nThe greatest proportion of urine cultures, 45.1% (111/246), were found to have no significant growth or no growth at all; 32.9% (81/246) had significant growth (single organism \u2265105 CFU/ml), and 21.6% (53/246) had mixed growth or, in one case, 0.4% (1/246) a likely contaminant (coagulase negative Staphylococcus sp.).\n\nHalf (50% (7/14)) of the patients reporting recent antibiotic use had a significant growth, and this accounted for 9.1% (7/77) of all positive cultures.\n\nAmongst the males, 18.6% (8/43) had a positive culture, all of which were in men younger than 50 years of age.\n\nOf the four men with penile discharge, one had a significant growth of E.\n\ncoli.There were 185 patients with valid POCT and urine culture, which are used in the remaining analysis (Figure 1).\n\nIsolated organisms in 41.6% (77/185) of significant cultures included the following: E.\n\ncoli 87.0% (67), Staphylococcus saprophyticus 3.9% (3) and one (1.3%) each of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus sp., Burkholderia cepacia, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes and Salmonella sp.\n\nOf the E.\n\ncoli isolates, 20.9% (14/67) were ESBL producers.\n\nThe one Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate was not an ESBL producer.\n\nAntibiotic susceptibilities for E.coli organisms are described in

infection of the urinary tract, sensitivity of the field tests increased but specificity and the DOR decreased (Table 2).\n\nTo elucidate this, further analysis (specificity; sensitivity; DOR) was calculated for the most commonly reported symptoms: dysuria (82%; 22%; 1.25), polyuria (58%; 55%; 1.71) and suprapubic pain (69%; 31%; 0.98).\n\nThese low figures explain why the DOR figure decreases when healthcare workers make the diagnosis of UTI/pyelonephritis (Table 2).TreatmentUsing only POCT to guide treatment (Figure 2), urine dipstick alone results in over treatment of 57.1% of patients, and urine microscopy alone results in under treatment of 25.6% of patients.\n\nDiscrepant dipstick and microscopy results were associated with lower specificity, whilst the proportion of both under and over treatment are minimised by the combined use of dipstick and microscopy (Figure 2).Figure 2.\n\nHypothetical proportions (%) of over and under treatment based on retrospective analysis of point-of-care testing compared to urine culture.Download figure to PowerPointHealthcare workers prescribed antibiotics in 63.2% (156/241) of all patients.\n\nWhen both microscopy and urine dipstick results were positive they adhered to guidelines and prescribed correct antibiotics for 100% (85/85) of these patients.\n\nMore than half, 56% (56/100) of the patients with discordant results (between microscopy and urine dipstick) received antibiotics.\n\nFor negative microscopy and negative dipstick, 21.4% (12/56) received antibiotics, including doxycycline in eight for unknown fever, and 3.6% (2/56) were still diagnosed with a UTI.Amongst 52.4% (97/185) of patients diagnosed with UTI or pyelonephritis, 71.1% (69/97) had a significant growth on culture, of whom 63.3% (31/49) had UTI and a significant growth and 79.2% (38/48) had pyelonephritis and a significant growth.\n\nThere were 10.6% (7/66) of cases prescribed antimicrobials for which the target organisms were not fully sensitive (Table 3).\n\nAmongst the 47.6% (88/185) not diagnosed with UTI or pyelonephritis, there were 9.1% (8/88) who had a significant growth on culture and these were discharged without antibiotic treatment.Table 3.\n\nAntimicrobial susceptibility of isolated organisms compared to prescribed antimicrobial in non-pregnant adultsAntimicrobial prescribedaAntimicrobial susceptibilityResistant %

unexpectedly, this rural and remote population had many of the typical features reported previously on community-acquired UTI including a preponderance of female patients [5], a high proportion of infection due to E.\n\ncoli [31] and discordance between POCT and gold standard urine culture [14, 16, 32].\n\nThis analysis demonstrates that the use of positive dipstick (positive leucocyte esterase and/or nitrite) alone in patients presenting with urinary symptoms in this population will result in a high rate of over treatment (57.1%).\n\nIn contrast, positive microscopy (WBC \u226510/HPF, bacteria \u22651/HPF) alone will result in under treatment (25.6%).\n\nIn this setting, a combination of these modalities results in a logical methodological approach for diagnosis of UTI.Obtaining both high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of UTI is not possible with current POCT [14].\n\nThe results suggest that continuing to test all patients with both microscopy and dipstick and not treating those when both are negative, treating those when both are positive and observing those with discordant results will limit unnecessary antibiotic use and introduce the concept of antibiotic stewardship.\n\nIn addition, continuing urine microscopy in this setting has a role in identifying acute kidney injury, for example in acute tubular necrosis, the urine typically contains tubular epithelial cells and cell casts of tubular epithelium [33].\n\nUrine microscopy is a more complex procedure than urine dipstick, requiring laboratory facilities, trained staff and quality control.\n\nWhere microscopy for malaria and TB diagnosis is established, continuing use of this POCT is cost-effective and it is appropriate to strengthen techniques and encourages reproducibility of results.High levels of resistant organisms were cultured (20.9% of E.\n\ncoli produced ESBL) although this is comparatively lower than the 37% reported from 97 samples (2009\u20132010) from two Thai hospital (Sirriraj Hospital in Bangkok and Songklanakarin Hospital, Songkhla, Southern Thailand) described in the Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART) [34].\n\nIt is, however, five times higher than described in the same setting in adult febrile pregnant women just 8 years earlier (2004\u20132006) [22].\n\nIn addition, rates of antibiotic resistance against cephalosporins, ampicillin, cotrimoxazole and gentamicin were comparable to E.\n\ncoli susceptibilities of community-acquired infections in Asia [35].\n\nIn view of this high and increasing resistance pattern, single-dose fosfomycin may be beneficial in this setting [36].This analysis quantified the proportion (10.6%) of patients who received, per guideline, antimicrobials to which the organism was not fully susceptible.\n\nStaff education to specifically inform patients about this possibility is ongoing.\n\nDespite more than half of the patients being able to provide a mobile phone contact number, this remains an unreliable method of contact due to economics (the number expires with the special deal), remoteness and the mobile nature of the migrants.At SMRU, the diagnosis by healthcare workers was accurate when both POCT were positive but specificity decreased with discordant results and inclusion of clinical judgement (Table 2).\n\nThis may, in part, be explained by language difficulties.\n\nWhilst Paw Karen, Sgaw Karen and Burmese are the languages directly used for patient care, medical language is more frequently translated from English.\n\nHence, the healthcare worker is at the intersection of translating patient symptoms to medical terms and correlating the terms in Karen or Burmese to English.\n\nAs an example, dysuria, the most common symptom, often translated as \u2018burning urine\u2019 is mistakenly assigned to patients with fever who have the sensation of hot urine.\n\nThis distinction needs to be emphasised.\n\nMedical education in developed countries puts a strong emphasis on clinical history for diagnosis, yet healthcare workers in resource poor settings have usually not had this educational opportunity and are more reliant on POCT [37].LimitationsTop of pageAbstractIntroductionMaterials and methodsResultsDiscussionLimitationsConclusionAcknowledgementsReferencesSupporting InformationRecent antibiotic use may have been underestimated as it is lower than the 25% reported in a 2011 survey in women from the same area.\n\nSTI as a cause of urinary symptoms and false-positive POCT cannot be excluded, but only a small number of men complained of penile discharge, and a low incidence of sexually transmitted infections is reported in pregnant women [27].\n\nThis work was undertaken in a low resource setting with healthcare workers without professional qualifications and therefore may not be applicable in a developed setting.ConclusionTop of pageAbstractIntroductionMaterials and methodsResultsDiscussionLimitationsConclusionAcknowledgementsReferencesSupporting InformationThe use of microscopy and dipstick concurrently is beneficial for improved diagnosis of UTI when they are concordant, allowing appropriate prescribing of antibiotics.\n\nDiscordant results remain problematic but are a target area for antibiotic stewardship.\n\nMicroscopy requires training and quality control but does permit a range of additional diagnoses for which more sophisticated testing remains lacking in many rural areas.AcknowledgementsTop of pageAbstractIntroductionMaterials and

Received: December 29, 2013Revised: March 13, 2014Accepted: May 12, 2014Published online: September 7, 2014 Abstract AIM: To study the effect of probiotic consumption on the faecal microbiota during and after antibiotic exposure.\n\nMETHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study with a two species probiotic combination [Lactobacillus acidophilus (L.\n\nacidophilus) ATCC 700396 and Bifidobacterium lactis (B.\n\nlactis) ATCC SD5220] on healthy adults during and after antibiotic treatment (amoxicillin 875 and 125 mg clavulanate).\n\nThe dominant faecal microbiota was studied by real time-polymerase chain reaction to determine if this probiotic preparation could facilitate restoring the microbiota to its pre-antibiotic state and influence the prevalence of beta-lactam resistance.\n\nGastrointestinal symptoms were recorded by questionnaire and Bristol stool scale.\n\nRESULTS: Subjects on the probiotic combination had significantly higher faecal counts of L.\n\nacidophilus ATCC 700396 and B.\n\nlactis at day 8 (end of antibiotic treatment period) vs those on placebo.\n\nFurthermore, subjects on the probiotic combination had significantly higher faecal counts of L.\n\nacidophilus ATCC 700396 and B.\n\nlactis at Day 15 (end of probiotic treatment) vs those on placebo.\n\nLactobacillus counts remained stable in the probiotic group over the course of the study, while Clostridium XIV group was higher at the end of the study and closer to baseline levels; this in contrast to the placebo group.\n\nBeta-lactam resistance in creased after antibiotic exposure and was not different between both treatment groups.\n\nGastrointestinal symptoms were generally mild and did not differ between the treatment groups, which correlates with the generally small changes in the microbiota.\n\nCONCLUSION: Consumption of the probiotic combination mainly leads to an increase in the faecal levels of the species included in the preparation.\n\nKey Words: Probiotic, Antibiotic treatment, Amoxicillin/clavulanate, Microbiota, Beta-lactamases, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium lactis Core tip: The influence of a probiotic combination on the stability of the intestinal microbiota was studied using molecular techniques.\n\nMost published studies have relied on culturing or have only looked at symptomology.\n\nFurthermore, this was studied

disturbances.\n\nWorld J Gastroenterol 2014; 20(33): 11878-11885 INTRODUCTIONAlthough the antimicrobial properties of antibiotics have provided great medical benefits, they may also affect the composition and activity of, in particular, the intestinal microbiota.\n\nThis disturbance in the balance and diversity of the composition of the normal intestinal microbiota has been identified as the major factor involved in the pathogenesis of antibiotic associated diarrhoea (AAD)[1].\n\nThe magnitude of these changes is influenced by the dose, type and duration of antibiotic use, along with the capability of the intestinal microbiota to resist colonization changes.Treatment possibilities for AAD are limited, but probiotics have been suggested as a potential way to counteract the potential negative effects of antibiotics.\n\nThe Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations and World Health Organization have defined probiotics as \u201clive microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host\u201d[2].\n\nVarious strains of probiotics have been shown to protect against bacterial and viral enteropathogens by producing inhibitory antimicrobial substances such as organic acids, hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocins, and demonstrating competitive inhibition for bacterial adhesion sites on intestinal epithelial surfaces[3].\n\nSuch properties may make probiotics good candidates for stabilizing the intestinal microbiota during antibiotic challenge.\n\nSelected probiotic preparations have been shown to reduce antibiotic induced microbiota disturbances[4].\n\nFurthermore, many strains of probiotics have also been found to reduce the incidence of AAD; a recent meta-analysis concluded that probiotics are associated with a reduced risk for AAD[5].The primary objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of a specific combination of probiotic strains on the incidence of antibiotic induced microbiota disturbances.\n\nThe secondary objectives were to investigate the influence of probiotics on quality of life and stool consistency during and following antibiotic use.MATERIALS AND METHODSThe study was reviewed and approved by the Therapeutic Products Directorate, in consultation with the Natural Health Products Directorate, Health Canada, and Institutional Review Board Services (Aurora, ON, Canada), and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.Study designThe study was triple-blind, randomized, placebo controlled with two parallel study groups.\n\nParticipants were stratified by gender at a ratio of 1:1.\n\nAfter successful screening, all volunteers received amoxicillin and clavulanate daily from day 1 to 7 and were randomly allocated to receive either probiotic or placebo daily from day 1 to 14, where after the volunteers had a 7 d follow up period.For the study, 111 participants were screened; 80 were enrolled (Figure 1).\n\nThe inclusion criteria were male or female aged 18 to 50 years; if female, either not of child bearing potential or using a medically approved method of birth control; body mass index 18.0: 29.9 kg/m\u00b2; healthy as determined by laboratory results, medical history and physical exam; agreed not to change current dietary habits (with the exception of avoiding pro- and prebiotics) and activity/training levels during the course of the study; gave voluntary, written, informed consent to participate in the study.\n\nExclusion criteria were - women who were pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant during the course of the trial; body mass index \u2265 30 kg/m\u00b2; average number of formed bowel movements > 3 per day or < 3 per week; smokers (ex-smokers must have quit at least 3 mo prior); participation in a clinical research trial within 30 d prior to randomization; use of antibiotics within 60 d prior to randomization; habitual use of pro- and/or prebiotic products; followed a vegetarian or vegan diet; unstable medical conditions; history of chronic gastrointestinal disorders; alcohol use > 2 standard alcoholic drinks per day and/or alcohol or drug abuse within past year; allergy or sensitivity to test product ingredients or antibiotic (amoxicillin and clavulanate), allergy to any penicillin antibiotic or cephalosporin antibiotic; individuals who were cognitively impaired and/or unable to give informed consent; any other condition which, in the investigator\u2019s opinion, may adversely affect the subject\u2019s ability to complete the study or its measures or which may pose significant risk to the subject.\n\nFigure 1 CONSORT patient flow diagram.\n\nStudy productsThe study products consisted of 12.5 \u00d7 109 CFU/d Lactobacillus acidophilus (L.\n\nacidophilus) ATCC 700396 and 12.5 \u00d7 109 CFU/d Bifidobacterium animalis (B.\n\nanimalis) ssp.\n\nlactis ATCC SD5220 (Danisco USA, Madison, WI, United States) in a hypromellose capsule.\n\nMaltodextrin was used as an excipient.\n\nThe placebo consisted of the same capsule with only maltodextrin.\n\nAt the end of the study, viable counts were determined and found to have deviated less than 10% from the target count.The antibiotic used was Augmentin (Apotex, Toronto, Canada); 875 mg amoxicillin and 125 mg clavulanate.ComplianceCompliance was assessed by counting the returned study product and antibiotic at each visit.\n\nCompliance was calculated as a percentage by determining the number of dosage units consumed divided by the number expected to have been taken multiplied by 100%.\n\nIn the event of a discrepancy between the information in the subject diary and the amount of study product returned, calculations were based on the product returned unless an explanation for loss of product was provided.\n\nParticipants found to have a compliance of < 80% or > 120% at any visit were counselled.\n\nA compliance of < 70% or > 130% was considered as non-compliant and any subject demonstrating non-compliance for two consecutive visits was to be withdrawn from the study.\n\nCompliance rates over 100% were explained by a visit later then intended and additional consumption of study product.OutcomesThe primary objective was to evaluate the maintenance of the intestinal microbiota composition during antibiotic (amoxicillin and clavulanate) treatment by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).\n\nTo this end, the following commensal and potential pathogenic microbial groups were analysed from the faecal samples: Lactobacillus spp.[6], L.\n\nacidophilus ATCC 700396[7], Bifidobacterium[8], B.\n\nlactis[9,10], Bacteroides[11], C.\n\ndifficile[6], Clostridium cluster XIV[12] and Enterobacteriaceae[13] by qPCR; using a ABI 7500 FAST sequencing detection system (Applied Biosystems Foster City, United States).\n\nTen-fold dilution series (10 pg and 1 ng) of DNA from the standard strains were used for the standard curves.\n\nFor the determination of DNA, triplicates of each sample were run, and the mean quantity per gram faecal wet weight was calculated.\n\nThe total bacterial count was analyzed by flow cytometry as described previously[14].Prevalence of antibiotic resistance caused by the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) was analyzed by a PCR and hybridisation combined method using a commercial Multiplex ESBL kit (BIORON Diagnostics GmbH, Ludwigshafen, Germany).\n\nThis kit detects a selection of potentially ESBL-positive bacteria by detecting all variants of the genes blaTEM, blaSHV, blaCTX-M and relevant ESBL phenotypic variants of blaOXA.Secondary outcomes consisted of Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS), bowel habit scores; frequency and consistency (Bristol Stool scale) and adverse events.\n\nThe GSRS is a disease-specific questionnaire of 15 items combined into five symptom clusters depicting reflux, abdominal pain, indigestion, diarrhoea and constipation; with a scale from 1 to 7 for no to serious symptoms.\n\nThe GSRS is well-documented[15] and norm values for a general population have been established[16].\n\nBowel habits were scored on a diary; for number of bowel movements, straining to start defecation, straining to stop defecation, feeling of incomplete defecation and use of laxatives.\n\nFinally, stool form was scored according to the Bristol Stool scale which describes and depicts the form of the faeces on a 7 point scale, from hard (1) to watery (7)[17].Adverse events, especially those for which the relationship to investigational product was suspected, were to be recorded and followed up on until they returned to baseline status or stabilized.\n\nIn the rare event of microbial overgrowth with subject displaying the symptoms of a bacterial infection, the study physician was instructed to prescribe an antibiotic to which the strains were known to be susceptible.Sample sizeA per group sample size of 40 participants was required to detected a clinically significant difference of 10% at 80% power, \u03b1 = 0.05 (2-sided), 15% difference in statistical methods, allowing for a 20% attrition rate[18].RandomizationA randomization schedule was created by the manufacturer.\n\nParticipants were stratified by gender.\n\nA total of 112 randomizations were provided (56 males and 56 females), to account for additional recruitment, lost bottles, etc.\n\nThe unique randomization numbers (112) were created using randomizer.org for each test product and divided over 28 blocks of 4.Statistical analysisData was analyzed on the basis of intention-to-treat.\n\nFrequency counts and proportions were used to describe categorical variables.\n\nSubject demographics were compared between groups using unpaired Student t test, Fisher exact test or \u03c72 test as appropriate.\n\nFor outcomes with continuous variables, comparisons of changes over time were analyzed by paired Student t test of Wilcoxon signed-rank test.\n\nDifferences between treatments were analyzed by unpaired t test or Mann-Whitney U test.RESULTSStudy participants and demographicsSubject demographics and characteristics were similar for both treatment groups, with the exception of alcohol use (P = 0.013), where the probiotic group tended to have more occasional drinkers (Table 1).\n\nTwo participants in the placebo group and four participants in the probiotic group did not complete the study (Figure 1).\n\nTable 1 Demographic description of the enrolled volunteers n (%).\n\nComplianceCompliance of antibiotics use was greater than 99% (standard deviation 2.7%) in both treatment groups.\n\nCompliance of probiotic/placebo use was greater than 100% (standard deviation 5.5% for the first week and 9.4% for the second week).Microbiota compositionAt baseline, no differences were detected between the two groups for any of the tested microbial taxa (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Bacterial counts.\n\nSubjects randomized to receive probiotics had increased faecal counts of L.\n\nacidophilus ATCC 700396 at the end of antibiotic treatment period and at the end of study product treatment period compared to those receiving placebo (Table 2).\n\nWhen comparing between groups, the probiotic group had significantly higher levels of B.\n\nlactis and L.\n\nacidophilus ATCC 700396 than the placebo group as long as the study products were consumed.\n\nLactobacillus levels were not affected by the antibiotic in the probiotic group; this in contrast to the placebo group.\n\nFurthermore, the B.\n\nlactis levels were restored to base line after completing probiotic consumption.\n\nIn the placebo group, B.\n\nlactis levels were still not restored to baseline at the end of the study (Table 2).Within groups, after one week of antibiotic and probiotic or placebo consumption, total bacterial counts and Clostridium cluster XIV counts both decreased from baseline.\n\nOn the other hand, Enterobacteriaceae were significantly increased in both groups (P < 0.001).\n\nIn the placebo group, Lactobacillus spp.\n\nlevels and B.\n\nlactis levels were reduced compared to baseline, while in the probiotic group, Bifidobacterium spp.\n\nlevels were decreased.\n\nThe level of L.\n\nacidophilus ATCC 700396 was increased compared to baseline (Table 2).After the additional week on probiotic or placebo, without antibiotics, Clostridium cluster XIV levels remained significantly reduced in both groups when compared to baseline.\n\nIn the placebo group, Lactobacillus levels and B.\n\nlactis levels remained below baseline.\n\nIn the probiotic group, Lactobacillus levels and B.\n\nlactis levels were restored to base-line but total bacterial numbers remained and Bacteroides remained below baseline (Table 2).After follow up, which was the last week of the study where volunteers did not receive either probiotic or placebo.\n\nClostridium cluster XIV levels remained reduced in both groups when compared to baseline.\n\nIn the placebo group, levels of L.\n\nacidophilus ATCC 700396 increased to above baseline levels while B.\n\nlactis remained below baseline (Table 2).Prevalence of antibiotic resistanceOne subject within each group had a positive baseline sample for beta-lactam resistance.\n\nAfter antibiotic treatment, 16 participants in the probiotic group and 14 participants in the placebo group showed a positive signal for beta-lactam resistance (P = 0.924).\n\nNone of the samples were positive for ESBL production.GSRSIn general, GSRS scores were low; 2 or less; i.e., no or slight discomfort.\n\nNausea was reported more in the placebo group at baseline compared to the probiotic group (Table 3).\n\nNo other differences were reported between groups at baseline.\n\nTable 3 Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale scores for the study participants.\n\nFollowing antibiotic consumption, both groups reported increased stomach ache or pain, nausea and diarrhoea; the numbers were similar between the groups and normalized in the following weeks (Table 3).\n\nThough not significantly different between the groups, the probiotic group reported a reduction in acid reflux after the follow up week (Table 3).\n\nOn the other hand, participants in the placebo group reported more constipation after the antibiotic and placebo week (P = 0.007) and after the follow up week (P = 0.034).Over all, total GSRS scores were different for both groups only after the week with antibiotics; probiotic (P < 0.001) and placebo (P = 0.007) group.\n\nThere was no difference between groups for the overall GSRS score at any of the assessed time points.Bowel habitsAlthough volunteers in the probiotic group had a significant increase in bowel movements after antibiotic administration (P = 0.032) this was not different from the placebo group.Bristol stool scaleSubjects in both groups reported increased Bristol stool scale values with the highest stool scale value on day three of the antibiotic period.\n\nThe probiotic group tended to have somewhat looser stools then the placebo group.Adverse eventsA total of 59 adverse events were reported during the study by 35 participants.\n\nAll adverse events resolved before the end of study.\n\nThere was no significant difference in the number of participants reporting any adverse event between treatment groups; 16 in the probiotic group and 19 in the placebo group.\n\nIn the probiotic group, one subject withdrew during the antibiotic supplementation period due to upset stomach (Figure 1).\n\nNo serious adverse events were reported during the study.DISCUSSIONAntibiotics have brought great benefits to medical practice.\n\nHowever, their antimicrobial activities affect not just the targeted pathogen, but also the endogenous microbiota of the host.\n\nThis disturbance in microbiota composition and activity is considered to be one of the reasons for AAD[1,19].\n\nMost studies on AAD and probiotics use patients as their study population.\n\nHowever, the use of patients introduces variability as the participants have different underlying diseases and usually get prescribed various antibiotics for various lengths of time and at different doses.\n\nWhen studying the effect of antibiotics on the intestinal microbiota and how probiotics may influence this, patients are not usually able to provide a baseline sample.\n\nThe design of the current study, using healthy volunteers that took the same antibiotic for the same length of time, allowed the baseline to be established and eliminated variation that may have resulted from differing lengths and doses of antibiotic usage.\n\nThe study design does, however, not allow for conclusions on other antibiotic regimens and/or probiotic preparations.\n\nA similar study set up indicated that a combination of five probiotic strains was able to maintain the overall intestinal microbiota composition[4].\n\nHowever, the study did not investigate specific microbial groups and the consumed probiotic strains by molecular methods, as was done in the present study.The antibiotic induced limited changes in the faecal microbiota.\n\nThe changes that were observed, were small and although statistically significant, the biological relevance may be limited.\n\nTotal bacterial numbers (by faecal wet weight) were reduced in both treatment groups, which can be explained by the looser stools that were produced.\n\nThe reduction in lactobacilli in the placebo group was not observed in the probiotic group and may be explained by the consumption of the probiotic that contained a Lactobacillus and may suggest a stabilisation of the faecal Lactobacillus levels by the probiotic.\n\nLikewise, levels of L.\n\nacidophilus ATCC 700396 and B.\n\nlactis were higher or more stable in the probiotic group; which was also likely related to the consumption of these strains/species.\n\nThe apparent increase in L.\n\nacidophilus ATCC 700396 levels in the placebo group at the end of the follow up period can be explained by the inadvertent consumption of probiotic products by some volunteers.\n\nEnterobacteriaceae were increased in both groups after the antibiotic consumption and this was not influenced by the consumption of probiotics.\n\nC.\n\ndifficile was not influenced by either the antibiotic or the probiotic, which was contrary to earlier observations where L.\n\nacidophilus ATCC 700396, together with L.\n\nrhamnosus HN001 was able to reduce the level and number of participants carrying C.\n\ndifficile[6].Only broad-spectrum beta-lactamases could be detected; mainly after the antibiotic exposure, and there was no difference in prevalence between the two groups.\n\nThus, the probiotics did not influence the emergence of beta-lactamase in the microbiota.\n\nNone of the analyzed samples were positive for ESBL.\n\nThe participants within this study were healthy adults, and since ESBLs are mostly prevalent in nosocomial settings[20], this may explain the absence of ESBLs.The limited disturbance of the faecal microbiota correlates well with the limited gastrointestinal complaints reported by the volunteers.\n\nWhile a significant increase in various symptoms was reported; these did not exceed a level of slight discomfort; Bristol stool scale values remained in the normal range and the number of passed stools did not reach the level defined for diarrhoea which is 3 or more loose stools per day.\n\nThe general mild symptoms could be explained by a relatively short exposure and low dose of antibiotics.In conclusion, consumption of amoxicillin and clavulanate by healthy volunteers caused only minimal microbiota disturbances.\n\nProbiotic consumption lead only to small increased faecal levels of the consumed genera and species.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe thank Minna Eskola, Julia Tennil\u00e4, Krista Salli, Jaana Larsson-Leskel\u00e4 and Kirsi Stenstr\u00f6m from DuPont Active Nutrition for

intestinal microbiota.\n\nThis disturbance is one of the causes of antibiotic associated diarrhea (AAD).\n\nProbiotics have been shown to reduce the risk of AAD.\n\nThe mechanism is thought to be by stabilisation of the microbiota, but this has been little investigated.Research frontiersStudying antibiotic induced changes in the faecal microbiota composition have been investigated only to a limited extent with molecular techniques as has the effect of probiotics on the microbiota.Innovations and breakthroughsTo study the effect of probiotics on antibiotic induced changes in the faecal microbiota, a challenge model was used where healthy volunteers under defined conditions were exposed to antibiotics and probiotics or placebo in a randomised and blinded study set up.ApplicationsProbiotics have been documented to reduce the risk for AAD.\n\nHowever, contrary to the common perception, the tested antibiotic (amoxicillin-clavulanate) appeared to cause only limited disturbance of the intestinal microbiota and hence the effect of probiotics on this was limited.\n\nProbiotics may therefore work through a different mechanism on AAD.\n\nThe administered species are found to be increased in the faeces.TerminologyProbiotic: live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host.\n\nMicrobiota: the microflora (and microfauna) in an ecosystem (usually an animal host or a single part of its body, such as intestines, mouth, vagina, etc.).\n\nAntibiotic associated diarrhoea results from an imbalance in the colonic microbiota caused by antibiotic therapy causing an osmotic diarrhea or allowing the overgrowth of potentially pathogenic organisms.Peer reviewIt may be worth to be published because of all the uncertainties around the use of probiotics to prevent gastrointestinal disorders related to antibiotic treatments.\n\nFootnotes P- Reviewer: Gurjar M, Lemaire S S- Editor: Gou SX L- Editor: A E-

local, national and international efforts are needed to counteract its emergence.\n\nAntibiotic use is considered as a key contributor for the increase and spread of antibiotic resistance (Albrich et al.\n\n2004).\n\nA major concern is the inappropriate use of antibiotics for non-bacterial infections and for self-limiting clinical conditions.\n\nAntibiotic usage in primary healthcare settings is high, and consumption of antibiotics for respiratory tract infections is the most common indication as documented for the developed world (Goossens et al.\n\n2005).\n\nUpper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) are the most commonly treated acute problems in primary care (Thamlikitkul & Apisitwittaya 2004; Francis et al.\n\n2009), with the majority of infections of viral origin (Mono 2002; Van Gageldonk-Lafeber et al.\n\n2005).\n\nHowever, data from developing countries for antibiotic use for URTIs are scarce, and surveillance of antibiotic use in the community is not in place.\n\nData and pattern on antibiotic use and resistance are prerequisite for development, implementation and assessment of antibiotic guidelines and for local and national prescribing policies (Malhotra-Kumar et al.\n\n2004; Goossens et al.\n\n2007).Upper respiratory tract infections or nasopharyngitis and colds are conditions that are most likely caused by viruses (Nyquist et al.\n\n1998; Snow et al.\n\n2001) and therefore do not require antibiotics (O'Brien et al.\n\n1998; Rosentein et al.\n\n1998; Avorn & Solomon 2000).\n\nGadomski (1993) performed a meta-analysis addressing the treatment of non-specific URTIs and found that antibiotics neither shortened the length of upper respiratory illness nor prevented the development of pneumonia.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) both advocate the same principle regarding the common cold that the use of antimicrobial agents should be avoided (Jacobs 2000).\n\nChildren treated unnecessarily are at high risk for developing penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumonia (PRSP) (Tomaz 1994; Frick et al.\n\n1998).Unfortunately, URTIs are common conditions for which the misuse of antibiotics is common and is reported from different parts of the world (Evans et al.\n\n2005; Van den Broek d'Obrenan et al.\n\n2014).\n\nUnderstanding the extent and pattern of antibiotics use for acute URTIs in the community is important for developing a regional intervention programme to promote the rational use of antibiotics and thus limits the spread of antimicrobial resistance for developing country where a surveillance system and antibiotic policy are generally not developed.\n\nHence, this study was conducted in New Delhi, India.The primary aims of this study were (i) to find out the percentage of antibiotic prescriptions by primary healthcare providers in public and private sectors with acute, uncomplicated RTIs, the majority of which will be URTI, and (ii) to determine the pattern of antibiotic choice in public and private sectors for these conditions in New Delhi, India.\n\nAs the diagnosis is generally not recorded on prescriptions, diagnosis had to be ascertained by asking patients about their symptoms.\n\nThis made it difficult to separate URTI from LRTI.\n\nHowever, effort was made to focus on symptoms of acute, uncomplicated RTIs like common cold/sore throat and acute cough, the majority of which will be viral URTI and self-limiting.\n\nFindings about the use of antibiotics in such conditions will give some indication of inappropriate use of antibiotics and would be valuable in developing strategies to improve primary care doctors' prescribing routine.\n\nThis study was conducted from December 2007 to November 2008.MethodsTop of pageAbstractIntroductionMethodsResultsDiscussionConclusions and recommendationsAcknowledgementsReferencesThis study was part of a larger study on surveillance of antibiotic use and resistance in the community, and data were collected from four residential localities (municipal wards) of New Delhi, India.\n\nThe four areas were as follows: Rajinder Nagar, Patel Nagar, Karol Bagh and Rajouri Garden.To get a complete picture of antibiotic use in the community for acute, uncomplicated RTIs, both public and private sector facilities were surveyed.\n\nIn the public sector, all eight dispensaries (primary healthcare facility) and two small hospitals (secondary care level) under Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCT, Delhi) in the study area were enrolled.\n\nAt public facilities, prescribed medicines are provided free to the population if those medicines are available in the facility.\n\nTwenty private sector general practitioners and specialists willing to cooperate for the study, practising in the chosen areas, including four paediatricians, three physicians and 13 general practitioners (GPs) were included from the private sector.\n\nAt private facilities, patients must pay for medicines.In the absence of community-based databases on antibiotic use, absence of disease-code classification, frequent absence of facility-based patient notes and doctors often not writing the diagnosis on the prescription, a method recently established for the surveillance of antibiotic use at New Delhi by conducting \u2018exit interviews\u2019 of the patients (Kotwani et al.\n\n2009; WHO 2009a,b; Kotwani & Holloway 2011) was used.\n\nPatients were asked about symptoms which generally represent uncomplicated respiratory infections and are self-limiting.\n\nData on antibiotic use were collected by trained data collectors (pharmacists) who conducted exit interviews of patients leaving the facility (Kotwani & Holloway 2011).\n\nData collectors visited each public facility twice every month and private clinics thrice every month to collect the data.\n\nData were collected from five private practitioners per month; the practitioners being randomly chosen every month were from a pool of 20 practitioners enrolled for the study.\n\nAll the patients coming out from the prescriber's office were asked whether they had common cold/sore throat/cough for the last 1\u20135 days and no persistent cough for more than five days.\n\nData collectors also asked patients whether they had mentioned these same symptoms (common cold/sore throat/cough for the last 1\u20135 days) to the prescriber and whether the prescription they had received was for the same symptoms.\n\nAny patient with the above-mentioned symptoms was labelled as having acute, uncomplicated RTI and was enrolled for exit interview, and his/her prescription was monitored.\n\nOther patients who were classified as having severe diseases, for example cough for more than 5 days, a written diagnosis of pneumonia or otitis media in children, were excluded from the study.A pre-designed proforma was used to collect data regarding the name, dose and duration of antibiotic prescribed.\n\nData collectors' schedules were randomly prepared for the day and time (1 h) of visits every month for data collection.Antibiotic use was measured in terms of the percentage of acute, uncomplicated RTI patients receiving an antibiotic.\n\nTo estimate this, the numerator was the number of acute, uncomplicated RTI patients receiving an antibiotic and the denominator was the total number of acute, uncomplicated RTI patients, whether or not they received antibiotics \u2013 both recorded during each facility visit for the time that the data collectors were in the facility.\n\nThe Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification and the Defined Daily Dose (DDD) measurement units were also assigned to the data (WHO 2008) to examine in detail the types of antibiotic prescribed.\n\nPrescribing patterns for various antibiotics in public and private clinics were analysed, and the consumption of each antibiotic was expressed as percentage of total number of DDDs/1000 acute, uncomplicated RTI patients attending all the public or private facilities.All data were entered into software developed in Visual Basic, SQL Server and Crystal Reports.\n\nThe same software was used to analyse the data.Ethical approval for the study was obtained from Vallabhbhai Patel Chest Institute, University of Delhi, India, and also from WHO's Ethics Review Committee.\n\nInformed consent was obtained from all participants and facilities involved in the study.ResultsTop of pageAbstractIntroductionMethodsResultsDiscussionConclusions and recommendationsAcknowledgementsReferencesA total of 1646 acute, uncomplicated RTI patients from public facilities and a total of 457 acute, uncomplicated RTI patients from private clinics were studied.\n\nNo clear seasonal variation in number of acute, uncomplicated RTI patients was observed at both public and private facilities.Percentage of prescriptions with antibiotics for acute, uncomplicated RTIsTable 1 shows the percentage of patients who were prescribed various antibiotics.\n\nAt public facilities, 45% of acute URTI patients were prescribed at least one antibiotic.\n\nSubgroup analysis for two secondary care level study hospitals showed that 44% of acute, uncomplicated RTI patients were given antibiotics (Table 1).\n\nDoctors at both types of public facility, that is, dispensaries (primary healthcare facilities) and secondary level hospitals (30 and 50 bedded), prescribed antibiotics in a similar fashion.\n\nThe highest consumption was for penicillins (J01C) and macrolides (J01FA), followed by cephalosporins (J01DA), fluoroquinolones (J01MA), co-trimoxazole (J01EF01) and tetracyclines (J01A).Table 1.\n\nPercentage of prescriptions with various antibiotics in acute, uncomplicated respiratory tract infections in public sector and private clinics (December 2007\u2013November 2008)No.SectorTotal no.\n\nof patientsPrescriptions with antibiotics% Prescriptions with antibiotics% Distribution of various antibiotics used1Public sector (hospitals + dispensaries)164674645.3Macrolides (29.3)Penicillins (26.3)Cephalosporins (16.2)Fluoroquinolones (13.1)Co-trimoxazole (9.4)Tetracycline (5.4)Nalidixic acid (0.13)Aminoglycosides (0.13)2Public sector (hospitals)29413144.5Penicillins (30.5)Macrolides (24.4)Cephalosporins (19.8)Fluoroquinolones (19.1)Co-trimoxazole (12.2)Tetracycline (3.1)3Private clinics457259 * 4 patients received 2 antibiotics56.7Cephalosporins (40.0)Fluoroquinolones (21.7)Penicillins (19.7)Macrolides (16.3)Tetracycline (1.9)Co-trimoxazole (0.4)4Private clinics (paediatrics)13884* 3 patients received 2 antibiotics60.9Cephalosporins (49.4)Penicillins (20.7)Fluoroquinolones (15)Macrolides (13.8)Co-trimoxazole (1.1)At private clinics, overall 57% of patients were prescribed any antibiotic for the treatment of acute, uncomplicated RTIs.

A few patients were also given older antibiotics such as erythromycin, doxycycline, ampicillin, cephalexin, cloxacillin, ciprofloxacin and tetracycline and relatively newer antibiotics such as amoxicillin+clavulanic acid and cefuroxime.Table 2.\n\nPattern of antibiotic use for acute, uncomplicated respiratory tract infections in private and public facilities surveyed in Delhi, India (December 2007\u2013November 2008)Antibiotic namePrivate clinics% of total DDDs of antibiotic prescribed to RTI patientsPublic sector% of total DDDs for antibiotic prescribed to RTI prescribedCephalosporins J01DA39.110.4Cefuroxime11.96.7Cefpodoxime proxetil8.6\u2013Cephalexin0.63.7Cefixime8.5\u2013Cefixime + clavulanic acid8.2\u2013Cefaclor0.4\u2013Others0.9 Fluoroquinolones J01MA23.619.7Levofloxacin12.7\u2013Ofloxacin8.715.6Ciprofloxacin2.23.7Norfloxacin\u20130.4Penicillins J01C19.131.0Amoxicillin+clavulanic acid14.07.5Amoxicillin3.015.9Amoxicillin+cloxacillin2.10.2Ampicillin\u20134.4Cloxacillin 3.0Macrolides J01FA15.524.6Roxithromycin11.414.7Azithromycin4.0\u2013Erythromycin0.19.9Tetracycline J01A2.79.5Doxycycline2.77.1Tetracycline 2.3Demeclocycline 0.05Combinations of sulphonamide with Trimethoprim (J01EE)0.034.8Co-trimoxazole0.034.8Total100100In the private sector, consumption in terms of DDDs shows that newer antibiotics such as cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, cefixime and cefixime+clavulanic acid, levofloxacin, ofloxacin and roxithromycin were the most commonly prescribed antibiotics for acute, uncomplicated RTIs (Table 2).\n\nOlder antibiotics were not generally used.DiscussionTop of pageAbstractIntroductionMethodsResultsDiscussionConclusions and recommendationsAcknowledgementsReferencesOur study revealed that antibiotic prescriptions for acute, uncomplicated RTIs were common in primary care settings, more so in the private sector (57%) than in the public sector (45%).\n\nWe focused on acute, uncomplicated RTI, most of which will have been viral URTI.\n\nIt is unlikely that 40% or more of such patients would have had lower RTI requiring antibiotics, so the proportion of patients prescribed antibiotics would appear to be high.\n\nOther studies have also described antibiotic prescribing for non-specific RTI diagnosis.\n\nIn primary care settings in the Netherlands (Van den Broek d'Obrenan et al.\n\n2014), overall antibiotics were prescribed in approximately 25% of infectious disease episodes \u2013 amongst respiratory infections, for acute upper RTI approximately 20% and for cough approximately 16% of episodes.\n\nIn primary care settings in Ireland (Murphy et al.\n\n2012), there was considerable antibiotic prescribing for conditions not included in the guidelines such as URTI (33.1%), cough (35.8%) and sore throat (53.1%).\n\nIn Poland, more than half of patients (54.2%) with a common cold were treated with an antibiotic (Panasiuk et al.\n\n2010).\n\nComparison with these data clearly shows that the percentage of patients who receive antibiotics for acute, uncomplicated RTIs in the present study at primary care was high.\n\nA WHO review of studies showed high antibiotic use for URTIs globally and in the Asia (WHO 2009a,b).The other important finding was the choice of antibiotic prescribed for these acute and uncomplicated symptoms such as common cold or sore throat or cough.\n\nIn India, we do not have national or regional well-recognised official guidelines for the treatment of common diseases and infections for primary care settings.\n\nMoreover, the prescriptions in the private sector are not officially regulated.\n\nHowever, the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCT) has an essential medicine list (EML), and this EML is separate for primary care and tertiary care hospitals.\n\nProcurement is supposed to be based on EML, and doctors are supposed to prescribe from it.\n\nThe EML 2007 applicable at the time of the study for primary care comprised the following antibiotics: benzathine penicillin and procaine penicillin (powder for injection), amoxicillin, ampicillin, cloxacillin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, nalidixic acid, erythromycin, roxithromycin, sulphamethoxazole + trimethoprim and doxycycline.\n\nCephalexin was mentioned for restricted use only.\n\nThese antibiotics are usually first-line or second-line choice for common infections and should be prescribed at primary care.\n\nThe survey revealed that all antibiotics on the list of Delhi state EML, even those which were supposed to be reserve antibiotics for hospitals, such as third-generation cephalosporins (e.g. cefuroxime) and fluoroquinolones (e.g. levofloxacin) and amoxicillin+clavulanic acid, were available and used in dispensaries (primary healthcare facilities) as found in earlier surveys conducted in Delhi State (Kotwani & Holloway 2011, 2013; Kotwani et al.\n\n2012).\n\nThus, public procurement and distribution did not appear to be following the EML.At private clinics, where no official guidelines or EML is implemented, the pattern of antibiotic use was different.\n\nIn India, around 80% of the population rely on private health care (Creese et al.\n\n2004).\n\nThe present survey revealed that second- and third-generation cephalosporins and other antibiotics such as levofloxacin, ofloxacin, amoxicillin+clavulanic acid and roxithromycin were prescribed for acute, uncomplicated RTIs. First-generation or first-line antibiotics such as co-trimoxazole, ampicillin, amoxicillin and erythromycin were rarely prescribed in private clinics.\n\nThe above-mentioned three studies from the Netherlands, Ireland and Poland have shown a different pattern of antibiotic use in primary care for RTIs. In the Netherlands (Van den Broek d'Obrenan et al.\n\n2014) for all respiratory infections, tetracyclines and amoxicillin accounted for about 65% of prescriptions and the prescription of macrolides and amoxicillin/clavulanate was about 14% and 10%, respectively.\n\nIn Ireland (Murphy et al.\n\n2012) for tonsillitis, 43% patients were prescribed phenoxypenicillin, which is the first-line antibiotic, and 20% amoxicillin and 25% co-amoxiclav, which are second-line antibiotics according to Irish national guidelines for the treatment of tonsillitis.\n\nIn Poland (Panasiuk et al.\n\n2010), high percentage of amoxicillin use for common cold, pharyngitis, tonsillitis and URTI of multiple or unspecified sites was reported.\n\nAll these studies reported either minimal or no use of second- and third-generation cephalosporins or fluoroquinolone for common cold, pharyngitis, sinusitis and cough.\n\nIn comparison with these studies, our survey showed that not only high antibiotic was high but also the choice of antibiotic for the treatment of acute, uncomplicated RTIs was also inappropriate.A qualitative study conducted with prescribers of both public and private sector facilities of the same municipal wards of Delhi where this study was conducted (Kotwani et al.\n\n2010) revealed that private practitioners' first important reason for prescribing antibiotic is financial consideration to not lose the patient to another doctor who will prescribe an antibiotic.\n\nThe various other reasons doctors put forth for prescribing antibiotics were: diagnostic uncertainty whether infection is bacterial or viral; they perceive expectation for antibiotic prescription from patients; and to satisfy the patient by giving something more than just paracetamol.\n\nDoctors from public sector facilities mentioned that because of patient overcrowding, they do not have enough time to explain to the patients that antibiotics are not needed.\n\nThese findings indicate that antibiotics are misused by many doctors for the treatment of acute, uncomplicated RTIs either due to financial gain and ignorance or due to various other perceived pressures.\n\nSimilar behaviour and findings for doctors have been observed by other researchers (Van Driel et al.\n\n2006).\n\nOther studies report that only a small proportion of patients explicitly expect a prescription, and even if they do, their primary concern is to find symptomatic relief (Altiner et al.\n\n2004; Van Driel et al.\n\n2006); patients were satisfied with careful examination and reassurance, irrespective of whether they received an antibiotic or not (Welschen et al.\n\n2004; van Duijn et al.\n\n2007; Fischer et al.\n\n2008).\n\nSimilar studies with respect to patients' concerns, beliefs and satisfaction are urgently needed in developing countries.\n\nA qualitative study conducted by Kotwani et al.\n\n(2012) for retail pharmacists in these same residential areas of Delhi revealed that pharmacists mimic the prescription of neighbourhood general practitioners and they themselves prescribe and dispense antibiotics for one or two days for acute, uncomplicated RTIs. Therefore, it is very important that doctors prescribe antibiotics rationally, as their prescription is copied by others who are actually not legally entitled to prescribe antibiotics.Surveillance of antibiotic use in these same localities in New Delhi has shown a high use of fluoroquinolones and markedly increasing use of cephalosporins from 2004 to 2008 (Kotwani & Holloway 2011).\n\nThe sales data indicate that overall units of antibiotic sold in India between 2005 and 2009 increased by about 40%.\n\nIncreased sales of cephalosporins were particularly striking, increasing by 60% over that five-year period (Ganguly et al.\n\n2011).\n\nThis increase in use of cephalosporins is worrying from the prospective of increasing resistance to them.\n\nOur study also indicates the increasing use of cephalosporins in acute, uncomplicated RTIs in the private sector.\n\nIrrational use of cephalosporins in these communities is resulting in resistance observed in E.\n\ncoli (Wattal et al.\n\n2009), and the continuous overuse will increase the antimicrobial resistance.Growing antimicrobial resistance has become a worldwide health threat, and it is worrisome because of the dearth of new antibiotics being developed.\n\nThe need for prompt action by all countries is urgently required to avert this developing global crisis.\n\nSurveillance of antibiotic use is one of the strategies to guide control of antibiotic overuse or misuse.\n\nBased on the country- or region-specific data on pattern of antibiotic use, policy and guidelines for rational use of antibiotics should be prepared and implemented strictly.\n\nQuality assurance programmes and public campaigns have been developed and launched in Europe to improve the use of antibiotics in primary care (Welschen et al.\n\n2004; Goossens et al., 2006; MacReady 2009).\n\nThe positive effects reported with these projects suggest that their implementation in other countries with high antibiotic prescribing may be effective.\n\nIn India, there is an urgent need to develop and implement treatment guidelines at primary care settings for rational use of antibiotics.The strength of this study is that it clearly shows that it is possible to collect useful data for antibiotic use in both public and private sector facilities, at the individual patient level in resource-constrained settings where a database is not available.\n\nThis is one of the few studies conducted in India that have shown prescribing pattern of antibiotics for the treatment of acute, uncomplicated respiratory tract infections in both public and private sectors.\n\nFindings of this study can be useful for conducting intervention studies to improve rational use of antibiotics in acute RTIs. The study has some inherent weaknesses.\n\nFirstly, it was conducted in four residential localities of one urban area, so generalisation should be done with caution for the rest of Delhi and cannot be done for other areas of India.\n\nSecondly, the presence of data collectors may have changed the prescribing habits of doctors at private clinics.\n\nDoctors may have prescribed fewer antibiotics than normally.\n\nIn public facilities, the bias introduced into doctors' prescribing may have been less as the data collectors were in the pharmacy area and doctors were not always aware which day and time data collectors were visiting.\n\nMisclassification as to whether patients were suffering from lower or upper respiratory tract infection may have occurred, but lack of recorded information on diagnosis meant that a patient interview was the only way to identify cases of acute, uncomplicated RTI.\n\nNevertheless, care was taken to exclude as far as possible cases of RTI that may have needed antibiotics, and it is likely that there were only a small proportion of such cases.Conclusions and recommendationsTop of pageAbstractIntroductionMethodsResultsDiscussionConclusions and recommendationsAcknowledgementsReferencesThis study shows a high use of antibiotics by primary care doctors for the treatment of acute, uncomplicated respiratory tract infections, most of which will be self-limiting viral URTI.\n\nChoice of antibiotic was more inappropriate in private clinics, where cefuroxime, cefpodoxime proxetil, cefixime+clavulanic acid and amoxicillin+clavulanic acid were

multiple factors contribute to resistance, including poor health infrastructure and the widespread, often inappropriate, use of antibiotics in medicine and agriculture.\n\nIn many developing countries such as Cambodia, the sale of antibiotics is unregulated and requires neither a medical consultation nor a prescription.\n\nIt is therefore likely that antibiotics are widely used in the community, and this may contribute to the bacterial resistance found in Cambodia (Chheng et al.\n\n2009, 2013; Emary et al.\n\n2012) particularly if taken at subtherapeutic doses and for inadequate durations (Morgan et al.\n\n2011).\n\nMoreover in a paediatric patient, the use of antibiotics is often inappropriate as many febrile illnesses are due to viruses (Hersh et al., 2011) and the prescription for an antibiotic may cause more harm than good due to short term side effects and long term consequences such as the development of resistance (Costelloe et al.\n\n2010).\n\nThere are guidelines to aid clinicians in the use of antibiotics in resource-limited settings.\n\nThe Integrated Management of Childhood Illness Handbook (WHO 2005) is designed for use in the absence of many diagnostic facilities and describes clinical indications where antibiotic use is appropriate, such as pneumonia, dysentery and very severe febrile disease.We used a low-cost, non-invasive technique (Liu et al.\n\n1999; Khennavong et al.\n\n2011) to determine how many children attending an outpatient department in Cambodia had evidence of antibacterial activity in their urine, suggesting recent antibiotic use.\n\nOur study additionally and uniquely, examined the presence of antibacterial activity against locally important resistant bacteria previously isolated from blood cultures in our hospital.MethodsTop of pageAbstractIntroductionMethodsResultsDiscussionAcknowledgementsReferencesLocation and participantsAngkor Hospital for Children (AHC) is a charitably funded 50-bed facility that serves as a referral paediatric hospital in Siem Reap Province, Cambodia.\n\nIt is one of two referral hospitals serving the paediatric population of Siem Reap city and province.\n\nAll paediatric patients younger than 16 years attending the outpatient department between 27 June 2011 and 5 July 2011, were eligible for inclusion (excluding 3rd July as there is no outpatient service on Sundays).\n\nProvision of a urine sample and written informed caregiver consent was necessary for participation in the study.\n\nSamples were stored at \u22124 \u00b0C for <8 h and divided into aliquots stored at \u221280 \u00b0C while awaiting batch testing within 6 months.\n\nCaregivers were asked for demographic information and whether their child had symptoms of fever, cough or diarrhoea in the preceding 48-h period.\n\nThey were also asked whether their child had received any medication within that 48-h period and if so which, and where it was acquired.\n\nEthical approval for the study was granted by the AHC Institutional Review Board.Laboratory proceduresThe bacteria used in the initial screening assay were Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Bacillus stearothermophilus (ATCC 7953) and Streptococcus pyogenes (ATCC 19615).\n\nEach organism was prepared to a 0.5 Macfarland concentration and spread onto the agar in Petri dishes and tested as previously described (Khennavong et al.\n\n2011).\n\nMueller-Hinton agar was used as substrate for the E.\n\ncoli and B.\n\nstearothermophilus isolates, and Mueller-Hinton agar with 5% sheep blood for the S.\n\npyogenes isolate.\n\nSix 6-mm diameter discs of filter paper were placed onto three Petri dishes each containing one of the three screening assay isolates.\n\nFive microlitres of thawed urine was placed onto one disc per assay plate.\n\nThis was performed in duplicate for each sample.\n\nThe plates were incubated for 24 h at 35 \u00b0C for E.\n\ncoli and S.\n\npyogenes and at 56 \u00b0C for B.\n\nstearothermophilus.\n\nThe zone diameter of inhibited growth around each disc was determined using a ruler.\n\nIdentical results between the duplicates were recorded, but divergent results were repeated.\n\nThe presence of any zone of inhibited growth defined the presence of urinary antibiotic activity.\n\nQuality control of the organisms and media was performed for each batch of samples as described previously (Khennavong et al.\n\n2011).Urine samples displaying antibiotic activity were further tested using the same methods.\n\nThese samples alone underwent a second freeze-thaw cycle.\n\nThey were tested for antibiotic activity against three resistant bacteria isolated from blood cultures from Cambodian children at AHC over the preceding 3 years: a methicillin-resistant S.\n\naureus (MRSA) resistant to penicillin, erythromycin, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin and susceptible to trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole and rifampicin using the CLSI disc diffusion standards (CLSI 2011); a Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi resistant to ampicillin, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, chloramphenicol, nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin (minimum inhibitory concentration = 0.25 mg/l) and susceptible to ceftriaxone; and an extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase-producing (ESBL-producing) E.\n\ncoli, which was resistant to ampicillin, co-amoxiclav, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime and cefpodoxime and susceptible to imipenem and colistin.ResultsTop of pageAbstractIntroductionMethodsResultsDiscussionAcknowledgementsReferencesDuring the study period, 3529 children attended the outpatients department and 775 (22%) children were included in the study.\n\nTheir median (interquartile range) age was 4.6 years (2.5\u20138).\n\n433 (56.7%) enrolled children were male (data missing for 11 children), and 581 (75.3%) children came from Siem Reap Province (data missing for 14 children).\n\nDuring the 2 days prior to attending outpatient department caregivers reported, 75.1% of children had a fever (582/775), 65.0% had a cough (504/775), and 24.3% had diarrhoea (188/775).69% (535/775) of caregivers had given their child at least one medication in the 48 h preceding presentation.\n\nOf these, 392 gave a single preparation, 123 gave two, 18 gave three, and two gave four (Table 1).\n\n7.3% (57/775) of caregivers gave a known and named antibiotic;

Morgan et al.\n\n2011).\n\nWe may have underestimated usage as this method depends on active metabolites in the urine, which are dependent on pharmacokinetic factors (Driscoll et al.\n\n2012) that were beyond the scope of this study.\n\nOther potential limitations are loss of activity during freezing and thawing of the samples and the possibility that other agents present in the urine may exert antibacterial activity (Khennavong et al.\n\n2011).A further limitation is that only 22% of children who attended as outpatients were included in the study and we cannot be sure that they were a truly random representative sample of paediatric outpatients in the hospital or of the healthcare-seeking child in the general population (particularly with another paediatric hospital in the region).\n\nChildren in the study were not selected by symptoms or presenting complaint, and inclusion was solely based on whether the child was able to provide a urine sample and consent to participate being given.\n\nCaregiver reports of infective symptoms were common, suggesting the included children were more likely to have had an infection.\n\nWe may therefore have overestimated antibiotic usage in the general paediatric outpatient population as children with suspected infection are most likely to have received an antibiotic.\n\nAgainst this, by including all comers, regardless of presenting complaint, we underestimate rates of antibiotic use in children with infective symptoms.\n\nAs these children were anonymised, we do not know whether any were subsequently diagnosed with bacterial infections (in which case the use of antibiotics may have been appropriate) or whether a resistant organism was cultured.\n\nThis would be an interesting focus for future work.The demonstration of zones of inhibition to local MRSA and S.\n\ntyphi isolates suggests that broad-spectrum \u2018second-line\u2019 antibiotics are being used in the community.\n\nHowever, the absence of urinary activity against an ESBL-producing E.\n\ncoli suggests that carbapenems are not yet in widespread community use.We are concerned that caregivers were administering unknown (often multiple) medications to their children, risking inadvertent toxicity from excessive dosing and drug interactions.\n\nThis highlights the need for better education and regulation of pharmacists, better packaging in the local language and the importance of literacy and empowerment of caregivers.\n\nOur study demonstrates the need for community-based surveillance of both antibiotic use and resistance in Cambodia (WHO 2009), an essential component of the antibiotic stewardship interventions needed to mitigate the threat of antibiotic resistance.AcknowledgementsTop of pageAbstractIntroductionMethodsResultsDiscussionAcknowledgementsReferencesThe microbiology service at AHC is part-funded by the Wellcome Trust of Great Britain, London, UK and the Li Ka Shing-University of Oxford Global Health Programme, Oxford, UK.\n\nUK National Institute of Health Research provided grants for academic clinical fellowships to KE and MJC through the University of Oxford, and University College London, respectively.\n\nWe thank the children and parents who participated in this study.\n\nWe also thank the nurses, laboratory and logistics staff who helped with the conduct of the study: Peng An, Ki Manich, Kong Sothea, Lim Sreylen, Manory Oum, Ouk Rachana, Sitha Chheang, Kik Mara, Ly Sollihak, Samneang Reachsey and Maria Riley.\n\nFinally, we thank Dr Bill Housworth and Dr Ngoun Chanpheaktra at Angkor Hospital for Children for their unfailing support.ReferencesTop of pageAbstractIntroductionMethodsResultsDiscussionAcknowledgementsReferencesChheng K, Targuinio S, Wuthiekanun V et al.\n\n(2009) Emergence of community-associated methicillin Staphylococcus aureus associated with pediatric infection in Cambodia.\n\nPLoS One 4, e6630.CrossRef,PubMed,CAS,Web of Science\u00ae Times Cited: 26,ADSChheng K, Carter MJ, Emary K et al.\n\n(2013) A prospective study of the causes of febrile illness requiring hospitalization in children in Cambodia.\n\nPLoS One 8, e60634.CrossRef,PubMed,CAS,Web of Science\u00ae Times Cited: 5,ADSClinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (2011) Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing;

{"content": "AbstractThe increasing rate of antibiotic resistance and slowing discovery of novel antibiotic treatments presents a growing threat to public health.\n\nHere, we consider a simple model of evolution in asexually reproducing populations which considers adaptation as a biased random walk on a fitness landscape.\n\nThis model associates the global properties of the fitness landscape with the algebraic properties of a Markov chain transition matrix and allows us to derive general results on the non-commutativity and irreversibility of natural selection as well as antibiotic cycling strategies.\n\nUsing this formalism, we analyze 15 empirical fitness landscapes of E.\n\ncoli under selection by different \u03b2-lactam antibiotics and demonstrate that the emergence of resistance to a given antibiotic can be either hindered or promoted by different sequences of drug application.\n\nSpecifically, we demonstrate that the majority, approximately 70%, of sequential drug treatments with 2\u20134 drugs promote resistance to the final antibiotic.\n\nFurther, we derive optimal drug application sequences with which we can probabilistically \u2018steer\u2019 the population through genotype space to avoid the emergence of resistance.\n\nThis suggests a new strategy in the war against antibiotic\u2013resistant organisms: drug sequencing to shepherd evolution through genotype space to states from which resistance cannot emerge and by which to maximize the chance of successful therapy.\n\nAuthor Summary Increasing antibiotic resistance, coupled with the slowing rate of discovery of novel antibiotic agents, is a public health threat which could soon reach crisis point.\n\nIndeed, the last decade has seen the emergence of deadly, highly resistant forms of pathogens, such as Escherichia coli, Acenitobacter baumanii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus and Staphylococcus aureus as well as non\u2013bacterial pathogens including malaria and viruses such as HIV.\n\nHere, we develop a mathematical model of an evolving bacterial population, which allows us to predict the probability of resistant strains emerging.\n\nUsing this model we show how sequences of drugs can be prescribed in order to prevent resistance where each drug alone may fail.\n\nThese model predictions suggest a novel treatment strategy: using sequences of antibiotics to \u2018steer\u2019 the evolution of a pathogen to a configuration from which resistance to a final antibiotic cannot emerge.\n\nFurther, we test the likelihood of resistance emerging when arbitrary sequences of antibiotics are prescribed, finding that approximately 70% of arbitrary sequences of 2\u20134 drugs promote resistance to the final drug.\n\nThis result serves as a cautionary warning that we may be inadvertently promoting resistance through careless (or random) prescription of drugs.\n\nCitation: Nichol D, Jeavons P, Fletcher AG, Bonomo RA, Maini PK, Paul JL, et al.\n\n(2015)

to antibiotic treatments within bacterial pathogens poses an increasing threat to public health, which, coupled with the slowing discovery of novel antibiotics, could soon reach crisis point [1, 2].\n\nNovel classes of antibiotics discovered since 1987 are few in number [3].\n\nThus, it is becoming ever clearer that if we are to combat highly resistant bacterial infections, then we must find new ways to prevent resistance and new applications of existing antibiotics to these pathogens.\n\nPublic health efforts have attempted to stem the emergence of resistance by reducing unnecessary prescription of antibiotics [4\u20136] and stopping the addition of sub-therapeutic antibiotics to livestock feed [7].\n\nHowever, such policies require global adoption to be truly effective [8], which they have not yet achieved, and is likely infeasible.\n\nRecently, there have been efforts to explore how existing antibiotics can be used in new ways to provide effective treatments for resistant pathogens, for example through combination therapy [9\u201311] or drug sequencing.\n\nThe emergence of drug resistance is governed by Darwinian principles, with treatment imposing selective pressure on a population that selects for resistant mutants.\n\nIt has been suggested (in the realm of cancer therapy, but with arguments equally applicable to treating bacterial infections) that we must design treatments which use sequences of drugs to account for, or even exploit, evolution [12].\n\nThe number of possible sequential treatments from even modest numbers of drugs is much too large for optimal therapies to be identified through an exhaustive experimental search.\n\nAs such, the development of sequential treatment strategies has become a problem best approached with the aid of mathematical biology.\n\nIndeed, sequential therapies have previously been explored in the field of cancer research where early mathematical modeling tested drug sequences to derive the so\u2013called \u201cworst drug rule\u201d for sequential cancer therapies [13, 14] (see [15] for a recent extension of their methods).\n\nIn the thirty years since these results were published a number of mathematical models have been developed which attempt to design optimal sequential or combination therapies.\n\nMany of these techniques are applicable not only to cancers but also infectious disease (see [16\u201320] for reviews).\n\nGoulart et al [21] used a search algorithm on graphs determined by fitness landscapes of Escherichia coli to design antibiotic cycling strategies\u2014long term hospital\u2013scale treatment protocols that cycle antibiotics in sequence over timescales of weeks, months or years to prevent resistance.\n\nHowever, our understanding of the mechanisms underlying these strategies remains limited and mathematical models which consider the entire space of possible strategies suggest that cycling may offer no significant benefit over mixed\u2013drug strategies [22, 23].\n\nThese models have led the authors (and others [24, 25]) to suggest that more sophisticated techniques are needed to determine optimal therapies.\n\nIn order to understand how to minimize the emergence of resistant pathogens, and to decide how best to design sequential treatments, we must first understand how their evolution is driven by the selective pressures of different antibiotic drugs\u2014a fundamental problem of biology [26].\n\nIn particular, if we understand which traits are likely to be selected for by which treatments, then we may be able to avoid selecting for those traits that confer resistance.\n\nRecent insights into the evolutionary process have yielded some actionable information.\n\nWeinreich et al [27, 28] showed that if the genome of a pathogen exhibits sign epistasis, where a given mutation is beneficial on some genetic backgrounds and deleterious on others, then there can exist inaccessible evolutionary trajectories.\n\nFurther, Tan et al [29] studied the evolutionary trajectories of E.\n\ncoli under different antibiotics and found that adaptive mutations gained under one antibiotic are often irreversible when a second is applied.\n\nSuch irreversible paths can occur when resistance conferring mutations for one environment carry a cost in another that can be mitigated by other compensatory mutations [30, 31].\n\nThese findings lead us to hypothesize that one antibiotic could be used to irreversibly steer the evolution of a population of pathogens to a genotype (or combination of genotypes) which is sensitive to a second antibiotic but also from which it is unlikely to acquire resistance to that antibiotic.\n\nThis hypothesis was partly verified by the work of Imamovic et al [32], who demonstrated that evolving E.\n\ncoli to become resistant to certain antibiotics can increase sensitivity to others.\n\nHowever, those experiments did not exhaustively consider all evolutionary trajectories but instead highlighted only those that arose in a small number of replicates; further, the authors do not consider how evolution may proceed once a second drug is applied and whether resistance can then emerge.\n\nModel Overview In this study we present a model that abstracts the evolutionary dynamics of an asexually reproducing population with unspecified, but variable, population size in which individuals are subject to point mutation at reproduction.\n\nWe model the genotype of each individual as a length N sequence of 0s or 1s indicating the absence or presence of N known fitness conferring mutations of interest.\n\nIn particular, our results are derived from a model of E.\n\ncoli with genotypes of length N = 4, indicating the presence of four possible amino acid substitutions (specifically M69L, E104K, G238S and N276D) giving 24 = 16 possible genotypes in total.\n\nThe fitness values associated with individuals in this model are, in general, abstracted away from biological reality but in the context of this work are empirically determined by average growth rates of specific strains under different drugs (see [33] for details).\n\nOur model builds on the well\u2013studied Strong Selection Weak Mutation (SSWM) model derived by Gillespie [34, 35] which assumes that the disease population is isogenic and that evolution proceeds as the population genotype is periodically replaced by a fitter mutant.\n\nThis model is valid under a broad range of circumstances provided that the mutation rate is not too high or the population size too small (a precise description of the necessary relationship between population size and mutation rate is provided in the Materials and Methods).\n\nThe benefit of this abstraction is that, provided they fall within acceptable limits, we are able to ignore the population size and mutation rate in predicting evolutionary trajectories.\n\nThis allows us to efficiently determine evolutionary trajectories and to consider trajectories either at the patient scale or at the whole clinic scale as in Goulart et al [21], although without explicit knowledge of the population parameters we are unable to predict the time taken to traverse these evolutionary trajectories.\n\nUnder the assumption of SSWM the evolutionary trajectory of a population can be viewed as a weighted random walk through genotype space which is determined by the fitness landscape imposed by a drug.\n\nOur work differs from previous models that utilize the SSWM model in that we encode this random walk formally as a Markov chain.\n\nThis enables us to determine the probability of evolutionary trajectories to the fitness optima of landscapes through matrix multiplication.\n\nSpecifically, we encode uncertainty about the current population genotype as a probability distribution vector \u03bc with length equal to the number of genotypes.\n\nWe can then determine the probability of reaching different fitness optima of a landscape by multiplying \u03bc by a limit matrix that is determined by successive multiplication of the Markov chain transition matrix associated with that landscape.\n\nThis encoding assumes that drugs are prescribed for sufficiently long for evolution to proceed to equilibrium in the fitness landscape.\n\nHere, we present the construction of the Markov chain from fitness landscapes and use this construction to derive mathematical results regarding drug ordering and cycling from the algebraic properties of its transition matrix.\n\nIn particular, we demonstrate that the order in which drugs are prescribed can have significant effects on the final population configuration\u2014a phenomenon we call non\u2013commutativity of selective pressures.\n\nUsing previously measured landscapes for 15 \u03b2-lactam antibiotics we illustrate how the emergence of high resistance, which we take throughout the following to mean evolution to the highest fitness peak of the landscape, can be both hindered and promoted by different orderings of selective pressures.\n\nFinally, we exhaustively explore all possible ordered sequences of two, three and four antibiotics, finding that the majority, approximately 70%, of arbitrary drug sequences promote the emergence of resistance.\n\nThese findings suggest new treatment strategies which use rational orderings of drugs to shepherd evolution through genotype space to a configuration that is sensitive to treatment, as in the work of Imamovic et al [32], but also from which resistance cannot emerge.\n\nResults Non-commutativity and Cycling of Natural Selection Using the Markov chain model presented in the Materials and Methods, we can formally prove that for a large class of fitness landscape pairs there is non-commutativity in the evolutionary process as described by the SSWM assumptions.\n\nSuppose that there are two drugs, X and Y, with corresponding fitness landscapes x and y, and that we wish to determine what, if any, difference there is between applying X followed by Y to a population as opposed to applying Y followed by X.\n\nWe can construct the Markov chain transition matrices Px and Py corresponding, respectively, to x and y according to Eq 3 and take the limits and of these matrices under successive multiplication.\n\nFor a given initial population distribution vector \u03bc, we can find the distribution over genotypes after evolution proceeds to equilibrium in the fitness landscapes by matrix multiplication.\n\nFor example, the distribution after drug X is prescribed is given by .\n\nHence, our model predicts that the ordering makes no difference to the final population distribution on an initial population with genotype i if, and only if, (1) where \u03bci is the population vector whose ith component is one and all of whose other components are zero.\n\nSupposing we do not know the initial population genotype, we can only guarantee that the order of application is irrelevant when the outcome is the same regardless of the starting genotype.\n\nWe thus require that for each genotype i.\n\nSince these unit vectors form a basis of \u211dN this occurs precisely when .\n\nIt follows that drug application will commute precisely when the corresponding limit matrices commute.\n\nIn practice we may be able to narrow down which genotypes are likely to constitute the population through bacterial genotyping or by observing that certain strains are not viable in the wild due to the high fitness cost of certain mutations.\n\nMira et al [33] empirically determined the fitness landscapes for E.\n\ncoli in the presence of N = 4 resistance\u2013conferring mutations under 15 commonly used antibiotics using average growth rates as a proxy for fitness.\n\nWe tested commutativity between each pair of these 15 antibiotics and found no commuting pairs.\n\nWe then tested 106 pairs of random fitness landscapes with varying ruggedness generated according to Kauffman\u2019s NK model for generating \u201ctunably rugged\u201d fitness landscapes [36, 37] using a random neighborhood Boolean function for determining the fitness contributions of each locus.\n\nWe fixed N = 5 and generated each landscape by first drawing K uniformly from {0,\u2026,N \u2212 1} and then using Kauffman\u2019s model to build a landscape.\n\nWe found that 0.132% of the landscape pairs generated had limit matrices which commuted, suggesting that commutativity is rare and the order in which drugs are prescribed will be significant in almost all instances.\n\nWe now turn our attention to finding antibiotic cycling strategies as considered by Goulart et al [21].\n\nUnless x is a flat landscape (taking equal values for all genotypes) there must exist at least one genotype j whose fitness is a minimum and which has a fitter neighbor.\n\nSuch a genotype satisfies \u2119[(i \u2192 j)] = 0 for all genotypes i.\n\nHence if x is not flat, the limit matrix has at least one column of all zeros and is singular, so there cannot exist a second landscape y for which .\n\nHence for any second landscape y there must exist a unit row vector \u03bci for which .\n\nThis means that natural selection in our model is irreversible, in the sense that for a given (non-flat) landscape we cannot find a second which is guaranteed to reverse its effects unless we first measure the population genotype\u2014a measurement which is non\u2013trivial and not currently common clinical practice.\n\nThis result precludes the existence of a general cycling strategy that returns the disease population to its original genotype regardless of that starting genotype.\n\nIf we do in fact know the starting genotype, as we might if the disease is contracted in the wild where resistance\u2013conferring mutations often carry a cost [38] which makes the wild\u2013type genotype most likely, then cycling strategies can be found efficiently by our model.\n\nIf the initial genotype is known to be i, the initial population distribution will be \u03bci and a sequence of drugs X1,\u2026Xk with fitness landscapes x1,\u2026xk will constitute a cycling strategy precisely when .\n\nThis criterion will be satisfied when \u03bci is a left 1\u2013eigenvector of .\n\nAs such, we can find cycling strategies directly using algebra and avoid the graph\u2013search technique used by Goulart et al [21].\n\nEvolutionary Steering Can Both Prevent and Promote Resistance Prescriptions of sequences of drugs occur frequently in the clinic, and often without any guidelines as to which orderings are preferable.\n\nCommon examples of this include treatment of H.\n\npylori [39], Hepatitis B [40] and the ubiquitous change from broad to narrow spectrum antibiotics [41].\n\nThe ordering of the sequence is therefore often determined arbitrarily, by the individual clinician\u2019s personal, or historical experience or from laboratory data.\n\nHowever, our model predicts the order in which the drugs are given is likely to have an effect on how the disease evolves and further, once a drug has been given it is not guaranteed that we will be able to reverse the effects.\n\nIdeally, we would like to be able to identify drug orderings that lower the probability of a highly resistant disease population emerging during treatment.\n\nTo consider optimal drug orderings in the context of our model we first need to know the fitness landscapes (or proxies of the fitness landscapes) of a number of antibiotics used to treat a given bacterial infection.\n\nExperimentally determining these landscapes requires one to consider all possible 2N combinations of genotypes in a set of N loci, a task which is prohibitively difficult for all but small values of N.\n\nDe Visser and Krug found that there have been less than 20 systematic empirical studies of fitness landscapes [26] and that landscapes have been calculated for a number of model organisms including E.\n\ncoli [21, 29, 42, 43], Saccharomyces cerevisiae [44], Plasmodium falciparum [45] and type 1 Human Immunodeficiency Virus [46].\n\nRecent work by Hinkley et al [47], which utilizes regression methods to approximate large fitness landscapes from samples of the space, could help ameliorate the complexity of experimentally determining fitness landscapes.\n\nMira et al [33] investigated the fitness landscapes of E.\n\ncoli under 15 different \u03b2-lactam antibiotics using the average growth rates of isogenic populations of each genotype under the drug as a proxy for fitness for a total of N = 4 resistance conferring mutations.\n\nFig 1 shows the evolutionary graphs of the fitness landscapes for three of these antibiotics, Ampicillin (Amp), Ampicillin+Sulbactam (Sam) and Cefprozil (Cpr).\n\nWe will first use these three fitness landscapes to demonstrate the steering hypothesis explicitly.\n\nIn the case of a single peaked landscape, such as that for Sam, we cannot reduce the likelihood of resistance as all evolutionary trajectories lead to the global fitness optimum.\n\nIt is only when a drug has a multi\u2013peaked landscape that we may be able to avoid resistance through careful choice of preceding drug.\n\nOf the 15 landscapes determined empirically by Mira et al [33] only the landscape for Sam is single peaked.\n\nIn their review of empirical fitness landscapes, de Visser et al [26] find that biological landscapes show a variable but substantial level of ruggedness, suggesting that multi\u2013peaked landscapes could be quite common.\n\nDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original

possible substitutions found in blaTEM-50.\n\nArrows represent fitness\u2013conferring mutations which can fix under the Strong Selection Weak Mutation assumptions.\n\nThe absence of an arrow in either direction corresponds to a neutral mutation which cannot fix under these assumptions.\n\nEach genotype is shaded according to its fitness normalized to a 0\u20131 scale.\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004493.g001In the following we take the parameter r in Eq (3), which determines how the probability of a mutation fixing is biased by the fitness increase it confers, to be zero.\n\nNote that changing the value of r will not change the accessibility of an evolutionary trajectory, hence by taking a different value of r \u2265 0 we will only change the result quantitatively (the probabilities may change) but not qualitatively.\n\nWe begin by supposing that we do not know the initial population genotype.\n\nThis assumption gives us worst case scenario results, and allows pre\u2013existence of any resistant genotype.\n\nWe model this situation by taking as our prior population distribution \u03bc = [1/2N,\u2026,1/2N] specifying that each genotype is equally likely to constitute the starting population.\n\nIf we apply the drug Amp to this population distribution we find that in the expected distribution (shown in the first diamond in the top row of Fig 2) each of the fitness peaks can be found.\n\nIn particular, the most highly resistant genotype 1111 can arise in the population with probability 0.62.\n\nSuppose instead we apply Sam first.\n\nIn this case as the landscape is single peaked the population will converge to the global optimum genotype 1111.\n\nThis genotype is also the global optimum of the Amp landscape and hence if we apply Amp after Sam we will encounter high resistance.\n\nWe have steered the population with one drug to a configuration which increases the probability of resistance to a second.\n\nNext suppose that we instead apply Cpr after Sam; in this case the population is guaranteed to evolve to a local optimum 0110 of the Cpr landscape.\n\n0110 is the least fit local optimum of the Amp landscape.\n\nThus if we apply Amp to the population primed by Sam \u2192 Cpr then evolution to the global optimum 1111 is not possible.\n\nThis example demonstrates the steering hypothesis, that evolution can be shepherded through careful orderings of multiple drugs to increase or decrease the likelihood of resistance emerging.\n\nDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF

distribution is \u03bc = [1/2N,\u2026,1/2N].\n\nWhen Amp is given first any of the three peaks of the landscape are accessible, with the most resistant genotype 1111 being most likely.\n\nIf Sam is given first to steer the population to its sole peak 1111, then resistance to Amp will be guaranteed when it is applied.\n\nAlternatively, if Sam is given followed by Cpr, then the population evolves to the local optimum genotype 0110 of the Cpr landscape.\n\nIf Amp is applied to this primed population the global optimum, 1111, is inaccessible.\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004493.g002To test our steering hypothesis more rigorously, we performed an in silico test of steering using combinations of one, two or three preceding drugs for each of the 15 drugs for which we know the landscapes.\n\nTable 1 shows, for each of the 15 antibiotics, the steering combinations predicted to minimize the probability of evolution to the most resistant genotype in the landscape of that antibiotic when applied in order before it.\n\nAgain we took \u03bc = [1/2N,\u2026,1/2N] to model the worst case scenario for pre\u2013existing resistance.\n\nWe found that for 3 of the 15 drugs there exists another which steers the initial population \u03bc to a configuration from which evolution to the global fitness optimum of the drug landscape is prevented entirely.\n\nThis number rose to 6 when pairs of drugs applied sequentially are used to steer the population and to 7 when triples were applied in sequence.\n\nDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Table 1.\n\nSteering sequences which minimize the probability of evolution to the highest peak of the landscape.\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004493.t001We then performed a second in silico experiment to find combinations of steering antibiotics maximizing the probability that evolution proceeds to the least fit local optima in the landscape of a final antibiotic (Table 2).\n\nWe found that, excluding the single peaked landscape for Ampicillin with Sulbactam, there exist 0 drugs for which a single other drug is able to steer the population to a configuration from which evolution to only the least fit optimum is possible.\n\nIf pairs of drugs are used to steer there are 3 such drugs (including the example presented in the above demonstration) and if triples of steering drugs are considered there remains only 3.\n\nThese findings suggest that through careful choice of steering drugs we may be able to prevent the emergence of resistance.\n\nDuring these experiments we found that 14 of the 15 antibiotics in our experiment (Cefpodoxime (CPD) being excluded) appeared in an optimal steering combination of some length.\n\nDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Table 2.\n\nSteering sequences which maximize the probability of evolution to the lowest peak of the landscape.\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004493.t002Whilst careful selection of drugs for steering can prevent the emergence of resistance, arbitrary drug orderings can also promote it.\n\nWe performed an exhaustive in silico search of all singles, pairs, and triples of steering drugs applied sequentially to prime the initial population \u03bc for a final application of each of the 15 antibiotics (Table 3).\n\nWe found that steering with a single drug increased the likelihood of the most resistant genotype emerging in 57.3% of cases and decreased the likelihood in 29.8% of cases.\n\nSteering with pairs of drugs increased the likelihood in 64.1% of cases and decreased it in 28.4% of cases and steering with triples increased the likelihood in 65.6% of cases and decreased it in 27.5%.\n\nWe tested the robustness of these results to changes in the value of r in Eq (3) and found that each of these values are changed by less than 2% for r = 1.\n\nFor r \u2192 \u221e we found that 56.0%, 68.1% and 71.2% of singles, doubles and triples (respectively) of steering drugs increased the likelihood of the most highly resistant genotype being found whereas only 22.2%, 20.0% and 19.2% of singles, pairs and triples (respectively) decreased it.\n\nDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Table 3.\n\nAnalysis of all possible steering sequences of length one, two and three.\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004493.t003For each of the antibiotics, except Cefaclor, Cefprozil and Ampicillin+Sulbactam (which is single peaked making steering irrelevant), we found that a random steering combination of length one, two or three is more likely to increase the chances of resistance than to reduce it.\n\nIndeed, for Piperacillin+Tazobactam and Ceftizoxime we found that a random steering combination will increase the probability of the most highly resistance genotype occurring in more than 80% of cases, suggesting that sequential multidrug treatments which use these very common antibiotics should proceed with caution.\n\nThese findings suggest that the present system of determining sequential drug orderings without quantitative optimization based guidelines could in fact be promoting drug resistance and that to avoid resistance we must carefully consider the order in which drugs are applied.\n\nDiscussionWe have reduced the evolutionary dynamics of an asexually reproducing population to a biased random walk on a fitness landscape.\n\nThrough this reduction we explored the evolutionary trajectories of a population by considering the algebraic properties of the Markov chain transition matrix associated with the random walk.\n\nWe have demonstrated that evolution on fitness landscapes is non-commutative, in the sense that the same drugs applied in different orders can result in different final population configurations, through parallels with the non-commutativity of matrix multiplication.\n\nFurther, we demonstrated that it is possible to find sequences of drugs that can be applied to both avoid and promote the emergence of resistance.\n\nIn particular, we performed an exhaustive analysis of the evolutionary trajectories of E.\n\ncoli under short drug sequences (two to four drugs) chosen from 15 \u03b2\u2013lactam antibiotics using empirically determined fitness landscapes and found that the majority, approximately 70%, of sequential treatments with 2\u20134 drugs increase the likelihood of resistance emerging.\n\nIn light of the slow pace of novel antibiotic discovery and the rapid emergence of resistance to the presently most utilized antibiotics, these findings suggest a new treatment strategy\u2014one in which we use a sequence of drugs (or even treatment breaks which themselves impose a selective pressure [38]) to steer, in an evolutionary sense, the disease population to avoid resistance from developing.\n\nFurther, the drugs used to prime the disease population for treatment by an effective antibiotic do not themselves need to be the most effective drugs available.\n\nThis means that there could be a large pool of potential steering drugs in the form of antibiotics which have gone unused for many years due to their inefficacy as a single agent.\n\nHowever, in the same way that the drug ordering can be used to steer away from resistance we have shown it can also be used to make resistance more likely.\n\nOur results show that we may be inadvertently selecting for highly resistant disease populations through arbitrary drug ordering in the same way that highly resistant disease can emerge through irresponsible drug dosing.\n\nThe most striking example is that of Piperacillin with Tazobactam, a drug often prescribed in a hospital setting after others fail, which has an increased likelihood of resistance when prescribed after a pair or triple of others drugs in over 90% of cases.\n\nIf we are to avoid resistance to our most effective drugs we must carefully consider how they are used together with other drugs, both in combination and in sequence, and take appropriate steps to reduce the risk.\n\nA major difficulty in using sequential drug treatments to steer disease populations is that in order to predict the outcomes we must know the fitness landscapes of the drugs involved.\n\nDe Visser and Krug [26] state that there exist fewer than 20 systematic studies of fitness landscapes and that these studies consider between 3 and 9 possible mutations.\n\nFor steering to be fully effective we must account for all likely fitness conferring mutations and their effects on fitness under many drugs.\n\nThus, many of the studies reviewed by de Visser and Krug are insufficient for determining clinically actionable steering strategies for certain diseases.\n\nFortunately, for a number of highly resistant infectious diseases [48, 49] and cancers [50, 51], only a small number of mutations appear to contribute to resistance.\n\nFurther, recent work by Hinkley et al [47] in HIV has introduced a method to approximate large fitness landscapes from relatively fewer data points using a regression method.\n\nIt follows that determining the landscapes is not an entirely intractable problem.\n\nA further complication in determining steering strategies is that fitness landscapes can be dependent on the disease microenvironment and have the potential to change from patient to patient or throughout the course of treatment.\n\nThe consequences of such effects on fitness landscapes have not yet been experimentally determined.\n\nTwo major assumptions within our modeling are that drugs are administered for sufficiently long that evolution can converge to a local fitness optimum and that this convergence is guaranteed to occur.\n\nThis assumption poses two potential problems in converting our model predictions to predictions of real\u2013world bacterial evolution.\n\nThe first is that if selection is strong and mutations are rare then there is a possibility of the population being driven to extinction before an adaptive mutation occurs.\n\nWe have chosen to ignore this possibility within our modeling as in the context of treating bacterial infections this would constitute a success.\n\nThe second is that the time to convergence could be prohibitively long for steering to constitute a realistic treatment strategy.\n\nWe believe that the assumption of reasonable convergence times could be valid as adaptive walks in rugged landscapes are often short [52].\n\nHowever, it has been shown that for certain landscapes there can exist adaptive walks of length exponential in the number of loci [53], but as we get to choose those drugs with which to steer we can avoid landscapes for which the convergence time is prohibitively long.\n\nFurther, our model is not necessarily restricted to the dynamics within a single patient.\n\nGoulart et al [21] used fitness landscapes to explore whole hospital scale antibiotic treatment strategies and our model, as an encoding of evolution on fitness landscapes, is capable of making predictions at this scale as well.\n\nAs such, even if evolutionary convergence is experimentally determined to be prohibitively slow for steering to be effective as a treatment for bacterial infection within a single patient, our results will still hold in scenarios which admit longer timescales.\n\nSpecifically, evolutionary steering could provide an effective means to avoid the emergence of drug resistance at the hospital scale or in long\u2013term diseases such as HIV or Tuberculosis.\n\nThe Strong Selection Weak Mutation model we have used here is a highly simplified, yet well studied model of evolution.\n\nThe model ignores much of the complexity of the evolutionary process, specifically simplifying the genotype\u2013phenotype map, ignoring the disease microenvironment and making the assumption of a monomorphic disease population in which deleterious and neutral mutations cannot fix.\n\nUnder certain regimes of population size and mutation rates these simplifying assumptions break down [54].\n\nFor example, if the population is sufficiently large then stochastic tunneling [55]\u2014where double mutations can occur allowing the crossing of fitness valleys\u2014can arise causing a breakdown of the Strong Selection assumption.\n\nSimilarly, if the mutation rate is sufficiently high then the population ceases to be monomorphic and forms a quasispecies [56, 57].\n\nConversely, if the population is sufficiently small then it becomes possible for deleterious mutations to fix [58\u201360].\n\nFinally, we have ignored the possibility of neutral spaces in the fitness landscape which have been shown to have significant impact on whether non-optimal genotypes can fix in the population as well as the time taken for evolution to find a locally optimal genotype [61, 62].\n\nThe only neutral mutation present in the empirical landscapes we use in this work is in the single\u2013peaked landscape for Ampicillin+Sulbactam (Fig 1).\n\nAs the landscape is single peaked, omitting this mutation does not prevent any evolutionary trajectories.\n\nThus, the results of our exhaustive search of sequential treatments are unaffected by the assumption that neutral mutations cannot fix.\n\nWe believe that each of the possible breakdowns of the SSWM model will have important consequences for the possibility and efficacy of steering, especially as larger landscapes are considered.\n\nHowever, a proper treatment of their implications is beyond the scope of this paper.\n\nIn our future work we aim to undertake a comprehensive study of the implications of population size, mutation rate, neutral drift and evolutionary convergence times on our steering hypothesis.\n\nTo further develop the theory of evolutionary steering as a clinically viable strategy for preventing or treating highly resistant disease we must begin to collect data regarding empirical landscapes.\n\nThe data cannot be collected at a large scale by the existing method of engineering all genotypes of interest and testing their fitness.\n\nSuch experiments are intractable for all but the smallest landscapes.\n\nInstead we must begin to measure and collect the genotypes and fitness of pathogens that appear in the clinic.\n\nHinkley et al [47] attempted to reconstitute the empirical landscapes for HIV-1 under different drugs which were later analyzed by Kouyos et al [63].\n\nThis analysis was only possible due to the availability of a data set of over 70,000 clinical samples of HIV-1 with recorded values of fitness under a number of antiretroviral drugs.\n\nSuch data sets for bacterial pathogens are not yet available but should become easier to obtain as the cost of genome sequencing continues to fall.\n\nOnce the data are available we will be able test the validity of many of the assumptions of our model.\n\nSuch a data set will also have many uses beyond the work presented here, for example in tracking the spread and evolutionary history of highly resistant disease through phylodynamics [64].\n\nThe model presented here is a simplification of the evolutionary process; however, given that non-commutativity is present in this highly simplified model, it is unlikely that commutativity will emerge as more complexity is introduced.\n\nIt follows that the cautionary message regarding sequential drug application which results from our simplified model merits serious consideration.\n\nWhether or not measuring fitness landscapes provides sufficient information to correctly identify, or to serve as a heuristic in identifying, optimal drug orderings in vivo is a question that cannot be answered through mathematical modeling alone.\n\nIt is only by verifying the predictions of steering strategies given by our model through biological experiment that we can determine whether they are viable.\n\nSupposing our model predictions are indeed viable, then knowledge of some approximation to the fitness landscapes of the presently most used antibiotics could, in combination with our model, provide at least a good heuristic for how to proceed with multi-drug treatments, future antibiotic stewardship programs and clinical trial design.\n\nMaterials and Methods Evolution on Fitness Landscapes We begin with the concept of a fitness landscape introduced by Wright [59] and used by Weinreich et al [27] and Tan et al [29] to study evolutionary trajectories in asexually reproducing populations.\n\nWe represent the genotype of an organism by a bit string of length N and model mutation as the process of flipping a single bit within this string.\n\nThis model of mutation only accounts for point mutations and ignores the possibility of other biologically relevant mutations such as gene insertions, gene deletions and large structural changes to the genotype.\n\nThis gives a set of 2N possible genotypes in which individuals of a given genotype, say g, can give rise to mutated offspring which take genotypes given by one of the N mutational neighbors of g\u2014precisely those genotypes g\u2032 for which the Hamming distance [65], Ham(g, g\u2032), from g is 1.\n\nAs such, our genotype space can be represented by an undirected N-dimensional (hyper\u2013)cube graph with vertices in {0,1}N representing genotypes and edges connecting mutational neighbors (Fig 3a).\n\nDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Fig 3.\n\nConstructing the Markov chain from a fitness landscape.(a) The space of genotypes comprising bit strings of length N = 3.\n\nThe vertices represent genotypes, and edges connect those genotypes that are mutational neighbors.\n\n(b) An example fitness landscape.\n\n(c) The directed evolutionary graph according to the landscape in (b) where the vertices represent genotypes and are labeled by the associated fitness.\n\nThe directed graph edges are determined by the fitness function and represent those mutations which can fix in a population (those which confer a fitness increase).\n\n(d) The Markov chain constructed for the same landscape according to Eqs (2) and (3) with r = 0.\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004493.g003We define a selective pressure on our graph that drives evolution, for example through an environmental change or drug application, as a fitness function (2) This fitness function represents a genotype-phenotype map in the simplest sense\u2014assigning to each genotype a single real-valued fitness.\n\nGillespie [34, 35] showed that if the mutation rate u and population size M of a population satisfy Mu logM \u226a 1, and if we assume that each mutation is either beneficial or deleterious, then each beneficial mutation in the population will either reach fixation or become extinct before a new mutation occurs.\n\nFurther, selection will be sufficiently strong that any deleterious mutation will become extinct with high probability and hence we may assume that this always occurs.\n\nIn the case that Mu2 \u2248 1 stochastic tunneling [55, 66, 67] through double mutations can occur and we cannot ignore deleterious mutations.\n\nAssuming Mu logM \u226a 1, then after each mutation the population will stabilize to consist entirely of individuals with the same genotype and this genotype will be eventually replaced by a fitter neighboring genotype whenever one exists.\n\nThis observation gives rise to the Strong Selection Weak Mutation (SSWM) model, which models a population as isogenic and occupying a single vertex on a directed graph on the set of 2N possible genotypes, {0,1}N, in which there exists an edge from vertex a to a neighboring vertex b if, and only if, f(b) > f(a) (see Fig 3b and 3c).\n\nThis population undergoes a stochastic walk on the graph in which the population genotype is replaced by a fitter adjacent genotype with some probability.\n\nIn fact, this model still holds in the case that Mu \u226b 1 \u226b Mu2 [26].\n\nSeveral \u2018move rules\u2019 have been proposed which can be used to select an adjacent fitter neighbor during this stochastic walk [52] and which of these move rules is most accurate depends on the population size [26].\n\nCommon move rules include selecting the fittest neighbor [36, 68], selecting amongst fitter neighbors at random [69\u201371] or selecting fitter neighbors with probability proportional to the fitness increase conferred [34, 35, 72].\n\nWe encapsulate each of these variants of the SSWM model within our model.\n\nA Markov Model of Evolution The SSWM model of evolution reduces the evolutionary process to a random walk on a directed graph and hence can be modeled by a Markov chain [73].\n\nFor a fitness function f:{0,1}N \u2192 \u211d \u2265 0 we can define a transition matrix P = [\u2119(i \u2192 j)]i,j \u2208 {0,1}N for a time\u2013homogeneous absorbing Markov Chain by setting, for i \u2260 j, (3) and (4) for each i (see Fig 3d).\n\nHere the parameter r \u2265 0 determines the extent to which the fitness increase of a mutation affects its likelihood of determining the next population genotype.\n\nIn the case r = 0, we have the random move SSWM model (as in [69, 69, 71]), in the limit r \u2192 \u221e we have the steepest gradient ascent SSWM model (as in [36, 68]), and for r = 1 we have probability proportional to fitness increase (as in [34\u201336]).\n\nIn the case f(i) = f(j) the mutation is neutral and, under the assumptions of SSWM, cannot fix.\n\nThus, this model differs from the Markov model used by [74] to study the neutral theory of evolution as we do not allow neutral or deleterious mutations to fix in the population.\n\nUsing this Markov chain we can explore the possible evolutionary trajectories of a population on a given fitness landscape f.\n\nWe next define a collection of population row vectors \u03bc(t) for each t \u2208 \u2115, where \u03bc(t) has length 2N and kth component which gives the probability that the population has the kth genotype at time t (where the genotypes are ordered numerically according to their binary value).\n\nThese time steps t are an abstraction which discretely measure events of beneficial mutations occurring and fixing in the population.\n\nAs such, the actual time between steps t and t+1 is not constant but may be considered drawn from a distribution parameterized by the mutation rate, reproductive rate and the number of beneficial mutations that can occur.\n\nThis distribution could, for example, be determined by a Moran [58] or Wright\u2013Fisher [59, 60] process depending on how we choose to interpret the fitness values given by f.\n\nIf the population has a genotype corresponding to a local optimum of the fitness landscape at time t then there are no beneficial mutations that can occur and this definition of a time step is not well defined.\n\nIn this case there can be no more changes to the population under the SSWM assumptions and for mathematical convenience we define the probability of a local optimum population genotype remaining unchanged as 1 in Eq 3 to ensure our model is a Markov Chain.\n\nIn this case the step t to t+1 can be chosen to take some fixed arbitrary time.\n\nThe distribution of a population at time t is related to its initial distribution, \u03bc(0), by (5) Since the Markov chain is absorbing we know that there exists some k such that Pk P = Pk [73].\n\nConsequently, we know that the matrix (6) exists and in fact this limit is reached after only finitely many matrix multiplications.\n\nTo intuitively see that this limit is reached in finitely many steps note that all paths through the Markov chain are strictly increasing in fitness and there are only finitely many states (corresponding to the genotypes).\n\nThus a given initial population distribution \u03bc(0) will converge to a stationary distribution \u03bc* after a finite number of steps in our model.\n\nFurthermore, if P* is known then we compute the stationary distribution \u03bc* as (7) In particular, provided a drug is applied for sufficiently long to ensure that the disease population reaches evolutionary equilibrium, we can explore the effects of applying multiple drugs sequentially by considering the matrices P* for the associated fitness landscapes.\n\nBy encoding the evolutionary dynamics in a Markov chain we can investigate the evolutionary process from an algebraic perspective.\n\nIn particular, as the transition matrix P encodes all of the evolutionary dynamics of the associated fitness landscape f, we can explore global properties of f by considering the algebraic properties of P.\n\nAuthor ContributionsConceived and designed the experiments: DN JGS PJ.\n\nPerformed the experiments: DN JGS.\n\nAnalyzed

(ii) an interview study of parents' experiences of primary health care (60 parents in total); and (iii) an interview study of clinicians' experiences of RTI consultations for children (28 clinicians).\n\nThe systematic review synthesised parent and clinician views of prescribing for children with acute illness.\n\nReoccurring themes and common patterns across the whole data set were noted.\n\nThrough an iterative approach involving re-examination of the primary data, translation of common themes across all the studies and re-organisation of these themes into conceptual groups, four overarching themes were identified.\n\nThese were: the perceived vulnerability of children; seeking safety in the face of uncertainty; seeking safety from social disapproval; and experience and perception of safety.\n\nThe social construction of children as vulnerable and normative beliefs about the roles of parents and clinicians were reflected in parents' and clinicians' beliefs and decision making when a child had an RTI.\n\nConsulting and prescribing antibiotics were both perceived as the safer course of action.\n\nTherefore perception of a threat or uncertainty about that threat tended to lead to parental consulting and clinician antibiotic prescribing.\n\nClinician and parent experience could influence the perception of safety in either direction, depending on whether previous action had resulted in perceived increases or decreases in safety.\n\nFuture interventions aimed at reducing unnecessary consulting or antibiotic prescribing need to consider how to make the desired action fit with social norms and feel safer for parents and clinicians.KeywordsUnited Kingdom;

Theoretical backgroundThere are multiple models for understanding health behaviour, but no clear basis for selecting one over another (Michie et al., 2005).\n\nComparisons reveal considerable commonality between the theoretical constructs of different theories (Michie et al., 2005) and similar predictive power (Redding et al., 2000).\n\nPrevious studies investigating drivers of consulting and prescribing have tended to focus on individual parent beliefs about the health threat (Wyke et al., 1990, Cornford et al., 1993, Kai, 1996a and Kai, 1996b), consultation benefits (Kai, 1996a, Kai, 1996b and Neill, 2010) or clinician beliefs about clinical or social need for antibiotics (Little et al., 2004, Tonkin-Crine et al., 2011b and Tonkin-Crine et al., 2011a).\n\nHowever, very little research into consulting and prescribing for acute childhood illness has explicitly used theoretical models or constructs to interpret observations.\n\nThis paper seeks to address this gap in the literature, linking the abstract concepts (e.g. social norms) to the concrete experiences and beliefs (e.g. children's vulnerability).prs.rt(\"abs_1st_end\");", "golden": 0, "journal": "elsevier", "id": "PMID: 26004209"}

design and methods We conducted a nested case\u2013control study using a large population-based database from the UK.\n\nThe cases were defined as those with incident diagnosis of diabetes.\n\nFor every case, four eligible controls matched on age, sex, practice-site, and duration of follow-up before index-date were selected using incidence-density sampling.\n\nExposure of interest was antibiotic therapy >1 year before index-date.\n\nOdds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were estimated using conditional logistic regression.\n\nThe risk was adjusted for BMI, smoking, last glucose level, and

anti-fungals and diabetes risk.\n\nConclusions Exposure to certain antibiotic groups increases diabetes risk.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section Introduction The composition and diversity of the gut microbiota affect pathways related to metabolism, inflammation and immunity, and are highly associated with human health and disease.\n\nSpecific changes in the microbiota were described in a wide range of diseases from inflammatory bowel disease to atherosclerosis and cancer (1, 2, 3, 4).\n\nIn the past decades, obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes have become a worldwide epidemic (5).\n\nRecent studies have emphasised the role of human gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of those metabolic conditions, showing increased prevalence among individuals with altered microbiota and low bacterial diversity (6, 7).\n\nAdditional studies demonstrated different microbiota composition in children with type 1 diabetes.\n\nThose works suggested difference in immune reactivity against certain bacterial strains in the pathogenesis of the disease as well as other auto-immune diseases (8, 9).\n\nDiet may alter the microbiota composition, influencing the body's ability to utilise energy from food.\n\nChanges in the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, the two dominant bacterial phyla in the human gut, have been described in obese subjects (6).\n\nDiets high in animal protein and animal fat were also associated with Bacteroides abundance, while Prevotella was associated with diets high in carbohydrates (7, 10, 11).\n\nSimilarly, in the Ob/Ob mice model, there was reduced abundance of Bacteroidetes and increase in Firmicutes compared with lean mice.\n\nThose changes in microbiota composition were shown to increase the capacity to harvest energy from diet (12).\n\nGerm-free mice remain lean despite consuming a high-fat, sugar-rich diet (13), and compensate for the reduced energy harvest due to lack of microbiota by higher dietary intake (14).\n\nMoreover, the obese trait was shown to be transmissible by colonisation of germ-free mice with obese mice microbiota (15).\n\nProlonged inflammation was also associated with insulin resistance and diabetes.\n\nSeveral works suggest that gut micobiota is involved in chronic intestinal inflammation (5), increased gastro-intestinal permeability and metabolic endotoxaemia, contributing to the development of insulin resistance (16).\n\nAn increase in the level of bacterial 16S rDNA in blood was associated with higher diabetes risk in humans (17).\n\nIn addition, mice deficient in TLR5 or in components of the inflammasome were prone to metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes (18, 19).\n\nMoreover, microbial products, such as short-chain fatty acids, affect metabolism (2).\n\nThose small molecules were also shown to regulate intestinal gluconeogenesis, thus influencing diabetes risk (20, 21).\n\nTwo recent studies have demonstrated change in gut microbiota in patients with type 2 diabetes.\n\nIn those large metagenome-wide association studies from China and Europe, there was an increase in the gram negative Bacteroides species and certain Lactobacillus species among diabetic patients as well as increased expression of pro-inflammatory genes (3, 4).\n\nTwo additional clinical observations support the association between gut microbiota and diabetes risk.\n\nFollowing faecal transplantation from lean donors, insulin sensitivity of recipients with metabolic syndrome increased along with the levels of butyrate-producing intestinal microbiota (22).\n\nIn post-gastric bypass individuals, diabetes can resolve even before any change in weight, possibly due to a shift in bacterial population with reduction in Firmicutes and increase in Bacteroides species.\n\nThose changes may be caused by the surgical procedure itself or be the consequence of change in diet (23, 24).\n\nAntibiotic therapy can alter the gut microbiota.\n\nIn mice model, low dose penicillin disrupt the microbiota, alter metabolic genes and induce adiposity (25, 26).\n\nIn both Ob/Ob and diet-induced obese mice, antibiotic therapy maximally suppressing the numbers of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria improved glycaemic control independent of food intake and changed the hormonal, inflammatory and metabolic status of the host (27).\n\nRecent works in humans have shown that antibiotic exposure among infants during the first year of life was associated with an increased the risk of overweight and central adiposity later in life (28).\n\nHowever, it's unclear whether change in the microbiota is the cause or a consequence of insulin resistance and diabetes.\n\nSince antibiotics are commonly used in western countries, the aim of the current study is to evaluate whether past antibiotic exposure is associated to diabetes risk.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section Subjects and methods Study design We conducted a nested case\u2013control study with incidence density sampling using the health improvement network (THIN), a large population-based database from the UK.\n\nThis design is computationally more efficient than a cohort study, and produces odds ratios (ORs) that are unbiased estimates of incidence rate ratios (29).\n\nThe study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Pennsylvania and by the Scientific Review Committee of THIN.\n\nData source THIN is a large population-based electronic medical records database from the UK that contains comprehensive medical records of approximately ten million patients under the care of general practitioners in 570 practices.\n\nTHIN includes information on patient demographics, socioeconomic status, medical diagnoses, laboratory results and drug prescriptions.\n\nUnder the National Health Services, 98% of the UK population receives all forms of health care through their general practitioners, thus the demographic and geographic distributions of the THIN population are broadly representative of those of the general UK.\n\nRegistration date is defined as the date when patients were first registered with a practice in THIN and Vision date is the date that a practice began using in-practice Vision Software which collects information for the THIN database (30).\n\nData quality is monitored through routine analysis of the entered data (31, 32).\n\nThe database has been previously used for pharmaco-epidemiology studies, showing excellent quality of information (33, 34).\n\nStudy cohort All people who received medical care from 1995 to 2013 from a THIN practitioner were eligible for inclusion.\n\n1 804 170 (15.34%) patients without acceptable medical records (i.e. patients with incomplete documentation or out of sequence date of birth, registration date, date of death, or date of exit from the database) were excluded.\n\nThe follow-up started at the later of either the Vision date or 183 days after the date at which the patient registered with the general practitioner (35), and ended on the diabetes diagnosis date for those diagnosed with diabetes during the follow-up and on the earliest of date of death, transferring out of the database, or reach the end date of the database for controls.\n\nCase selection Cases were defined as all individuals in the cohort with at least one Read code (the standard clinical terminology system used in general practices in the UK) for diabetes mellitus during the follow-up period.\n\nSubjects who were diagnosed with the diabetes within the first 183 days after initiation of follow-up were excluded in order to avoid prevalent cases (35).\n\nSelection of controls Selection of the control group was based on incidence-density sampling (29).\n\nThe eligible control pool for each case consisted of all individuals without a diagnosis of diabetes at the date the case was diagnosed.\n\nFor each case, up to four eligible controls were matched on age at index, sex, practice site, duration and calendar period of follow-up.\n\nExposures and covariates The primary exposure of interest was any exposure more than 1 year before the index date to one of seven antibiotic groups commonly used in the outpatient setting: penicillins, cephalosporins, macrolides, tetracyclines, sulphonamides, quinolones and imidazole.\n\nThe analysis was performed for each antibiotic class separately.\n\nWe also assessed anti-viral and anti-fungal medications as potential negative controls.\n\nFor each of the antibiotic classes, we evaluated the effect of number of antibiotic courses (0, 1, 2\u20135 and >5 courses).\n\nAs potential confounders, we examined a comprehensive list of variables including obesity (BMI >30); smoking history (ever or never); medical co-morbidities including coronary artery disease and hyperlipidaemia treated with statins; number of previous urinary, skin and respiratory infections; and last glucose measure before or at diagnosis date.\n\nAll covariates were measured before the index date.\n\nStatistical analyses The baseline characteristics of cases and controls were compared using \u03c72 test for categorical variables and t-test for continuous variables.\n\nThe primary analysis was a conditional logistic regression to estimate ORs and 95% CIs for the association between number of antibiotic courses for each antibiotic class and diabetes risk.\n\nThe reference exposure group consisted of individuals without documented therapy with the specific antibiotic.\n\nThe analysis was adjusted for all potential confounders.\n\nBonferroni correction was performed to account for multiple comparisons due to assessment of nine treatment groups (seven antimicrobial groups as well as anti-viral and anti-fungal).\n\nThe analysis was repeated only among individuals without urinary or skin infections before index date to minimise indication bias.\n\nFor penicillins, due to the large number of prescriptions and high statistical power, we were able to repeat the analysis among individuals with last antibiotic prescription more than 5 years before diagnosis date.\n\nIn this analysis, we did not adjust to last glucose value and the number of infections before index date as they occurred after exposure.\n\nIn an additional sensitivity analysis, we evaluated the association between antibiotic exposure and auto-immune type 1 diabetes compared with type 2 disease that is associated with insulin resistance.\n\nThe definition for type 1 diabetes included individuals with specific Read codes for the disease, individuals who initiated insulin therapy within 90 days of diagnosis and individuals below the age of 30 at the time of diagnosis.\n\nFurthermore, since glucose level might be part of the causal pathway between insulin resistance and diabetes, infection and antibiotic use we repeated the analysis without adjustment to this variable.\n\nAll analyses were performed using STATA 13 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX, USA).\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section Results The study population included 208 002 diabetic cases and 815 576 matched controls (Table 1).\n\nAs expected, diabetic patients had elevated risk for high BMI, hyperlipidaemia and coronary artery disease, as part of the metabolic syndrome.\n\nIn addition, cases had higher rate of infections before diagnosis date compared with controls, especially of the urinary tract (19.3% vs 15.1%) and skin (17.8% vs 12.4%).\n\nThe most commonly prescribed antibiotic among the study population was penicillin, with 426 159 subjects (41.6%) receiving at least one prescription during follow-up period, followed by macrolides (150 996 subjects, 14.8%) and TMP/SMX (120 494 subjects, 11.8%).\n\nView this table: In this window In a new window Table 1 Characteristics of cases and controls.\n\nThe univariate analysis demonstrated increased diabetes risk with all antibiotic groups, reaching to an OR of 2.12 (95% CI 2.08\u20132.17) for exposure to more than five antibiotic courses of penicillins (Table 2).\n\nIn the multivariate analysis, a single antibiotic prescription more than 1 year before diagnosis date was not associated with higher adjusted diabetes risk in all antibiotic groups after applying the Bonferroni correction.\n\nThe only exception was treatment with cephalosporins that was associated with a modest increase in diabetes risk (adjusted OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.05\u20131.13).\n\nTreatment with two to five antibiotic courses was associated with increase in diabetes risk for penicillin, cephalosporins, macrolides and quinolones with adjusted OR ranging from 1.08 (95% CI 1.05\u20131.11) for penicillin to 1.15 (95% CI 1.08\u20131.23) for quinolones.\n\nThe risk increased with the number of antibiotic courses and reached 1.37 (95% CI 1.19\u20131.58) for more than five courses of quinolones.\n\nFor two to five antibiotic courses, there was a modest increase in diabetes risk with TMP/SMX use (adjusted OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.05\u20131.15).\n\nFor more than five antibiotic courses, there was also an elevated risk with tetracyclines (adjusted OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.09\u20131.33).\n\nThere was no association between treatment with imidazole, anti-virals and anti-fungals and diabetes risk independent of the number of treatment courses (Table 2).\n\nView this table: In this window In a new window Table 2 Diabetes risk as a function of the number of specific antibiotic courses.\n\nIn a sensitivity analysis performed only among subjects without urinary tract or skin infections before index date, there was no change in results apart from lack of association between any number of TMP/SMX courses and diabetes risk (Table 3).\n\nIn additionally, among subjects on last penicillin prescription more than 5 years before diagnosis with diabetes, the unadjusted ORs were 1.18 (95% CI 1.15\u20131.21), 1.57 (95% CI 1.43\u20131.74) and 1.87 (95% CI 1.39\u20132.52) for 1, 2\u20135 and more than five antibiotic courses, respectively, all with P<0.0001.\n\nThe adjusted ORs were 1.05 (95% CI 1.02\u20131.08, P=0.002), 1.23 (95% CI 1.1\u20131.37, P<0.0001), 1.33 (95% CI 0.95\u20131.86, P=0.09) respectively.\n\nView this table: In this window In a new window Table 3 Diabetes risk among subjects without previous urinary or skin infections, as a function of the number of specific antibiotic courses.\n\nWhen only subjects with type 1 diabetes were analysed, there was an association only between exposure to more than five courses of penicillin or two to five courses of cephalosporin and disease risk (ORs 1.41 95% CI 1.11\u20131.78 and 1.63 95% CI 1.26\u20132.11 respectively).\n\nNo association was observed between other antibiotic groups or number of antibiotic courses prescribed and diabetes risk (Table 4).\n\nView this table: In this window In a new window Table 4 Diabetes risk among subjects with type 1 diabetes as a function of the number of specific antibiotic courses.\n\nIn an additional sensitivity analysis not adjusted to last glucose level before or at diagnosis, there was an even higher increase in diabetes risk.\n\nIn this analysis, the risk was demonstrated with all antibiotic groups and with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes (data not shown).\n\nThe risk for type 1 diabetes increased with the number of antibiotic courses from 1.09 (95% CI 1.03\u20131.16) for a single course of penicillin to 1.67 (95% CI 1.53\u20131.83) for more than five courses.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section Discussion In this large population-based study, we showed an association between past antibiotic exposure and diabetes risk.\n\nThis association was more pronounced with increased number of antibiotic courses prescribed.\n\nWhile the univariate analysis demonstrated a higher risk with exposure to all antibiotic groups and for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, the adjusted analysis revealed an increase in risk only after exposure to more than one course of penicillin, cephalosporins, macrolides and quinolones, and showed almost no change in risk for participants with type 1 diabetes.\n\nThe OR reached 1.15 (95% CI 1.08\u20131.23, P<0.0001) for two to five courses and 1.37 (95% CI 1.19\u20131.58, P<0.0001) for more than five courses of quinolones.\n\nThere was no increase in risk with exposure to anti-viral or anti-fungal medications.\n\nThere was no change in association when a stratified analysis only among subjects without previous urinary or skin infections before index date was performed.\n\nThose results are consistent with previous studies in humans, showing microbial changes in patients with type 2 diabetes (3, 4) and increased risk of overweight among infants who were exposed to antibiotics during the first year of life (28).\n\nThey are also consistent with mice models showing disruption of the microbiota, altered metabolic gene expression and induced adiposity following low dose antibiotic (25, 26).\n\nHowever, in models of obese mice, antibiotic administration with maximal suppression of the microbiota improved glycaemic control (27).\n\nOne possible explanation is that certain bacteria are necessary in order to cause the phenotype of obesity and diabetes, and low dose antibiotics might increase the \u2018necessary pro-diabetes microbiota\u2019.\n\nThe fact that germ-free mice remain lean even after consuming western diet supports the role of a \u2018pro-diabetes microbiota\u2019 (13).\n\nThe current study had more than one million subjects, of them 208 002 diabetic patients, with a follow-up of up to 18 years.\n\nOnly individuals who were diagnosed more than 6 months after initiation of follow-up were considered as cases in order to avoid prevalent cases.\n\nOver 40% of participants had at least one antibiotic prescription during the study duration.\n\nBy matching cases and controls on duration and calendar period of follow-up as well as practice site, we avoided time\u2013window bias and minimised confounding secondary to different clinical judgment regarding antibiotic prescription and type of antibiotic used.\n\nIn order to avoid possible protopathic bias (i.e. infections in the period before diagnosis could be the results of infections associated with undiagnosed diabetes), we analysed only antibiotic prescriptions given more than 1 year before diagnosis date.\n\nAdjustment to the number of previous urinary, skin and respiratory tract infections, as well as the sensitivity analysis among subjects without previous urinary and skin infections, known to be higher in diabetic patients, limited the possibility of confounding by indication.\n\nFor penicillins, we were able to analyse the effect of antibiotic exposure more than 5 years before diabetes was diagnosed, allowing us to evaluate possible reverse causation in which the pre-diabetes state of insulin resistance increased infection risk and antibiotic use.\n\nThe results for this sensitivity analysis were similar to the overall analysis pointing against possible overuse of antibiotics due to pre-diabetes state.\n\nWe further adjusted to obesity, hyperlipidaemia treated with statins, last glucose level before or at diagnosis and coronary artery disease.\n\nAll those variables, together with diabetes, are part of the metabolic syndrome.\n\nThose parameters are associated with diabetes as well as with change in the microbiota and thus serve as possible confounders.\n\nThe current work had several limitations.\n\nInformation regarding BMI was missing for \u223c30% of the study population, because unlike prescription or medical diagnosis information in THIN, recording of BMI data was not mandated by the general practices.\n\nWe analysed subjects with missing BMI information as a separate group and additionally performed complete-subject analysis which showed no change in results.\n\nOf note, obesity is the known risk factor for diabetes and metabolic syndrome, the percent of obese (BMI >30) participants in the current study were \u223c22% compared with the reported 26% of the UK population in 2010 (HSCIC: Statistics on Obesity, Physical Activity and Diet \u2013 England, 2012).\n\nThe cases were defined according to at least one Read code for diabetes mellitus.\n\nBecause many codes did not specify the type of diabetes that was diagnosed, in addition to specific type 1 diabetes codes, we included age <30 and initial insulin prescription within 90 days of diagnosis as additional definitions for the disease.\n\nThe overall analysis was performed in patients with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes.\n\nOur observational study did not include information regarding the microbiota composition of cases and controls and thus cannot infer causality.\n\nHowever, as change in the microbiota was previously demonstrated in humans in the entire spectrum of pathologies from obesity to insulin resistance and diabetes and as earlier studies showed antibiotic exposure as a risk factor for obesity (3, 4, 28), our results may support a possible hypothesis that change in the gut microbiota secondary to antibiotic exposure increase diabetes risk.\n\nThe need for recurrent antibiotic exposures in addition to the lack of known direct harmful effect of antibiotics on the \u03b2-cells of the pancreas is in concordance with such a hypothesis.\n\nWe had no information regarding whether the antibiotics prescribed were actually taken; however we expect that if compliance was actually lower it would have changed our results towards the null hypothesis.\n\nPeople may also use more than one type of antibiotic during follow-up, making it difficult to differentiate between the effects of different antibiotic groups.\n\nOur study results, showing differential effect between groups as well as compared with anti-viral and most anti-fungal medications, point against possible surveillance bias (i.e. people with infections are more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes).\n\nAs we performed multiple comparison for exposure to various pre-defined antibiotic groups, we used the conservative Bonferonni correction in the final statistical analysis.\n\nImportantly, although both unadjusted and adjusted analysis showed an association between antibiotic exposure and diabetes risk, the results differ in the magnitude of risk, the antibiotic groups associated with the risk and the effect on type 1 diabetes (increased risk in the univariate analysis vs almost no risk in the adjusted analysis).\n\nWhile the lack of association in type 1 diabetes might be explained by the different auto-immune pathogenesis of the disease, possibly viral induced (36, 37), we could not rule out over adjustment, decreasing the risk towards the null hypothesis, as an alternate explanation for our results.\n\nFor this reason, we conducted a sensitivity analysis without adjustment for last glucose levels that might serve as part of a causal pathway between antibiotic exposure and diabetes risk.\n\nIn this analysis, antibiotic exposure was associated with type 1 diabetes.\n\nThese contrasting results prevent us from clear conclusions regarding type 1 diabetes and further studies are needed.\n\nIn summary, we demonstrated a higher adjusted risk for type 2 diabetes among individuals with recurrent exposures to penicillin, cephalosporins, macrolides and quinolones.\n\nThere was no increase in adjusted risk for exposure to anti-viral or anti-fungal medications.\n\nDespite the observational design and possibility of unmeasured confounding, the results are consistent with previous works that described altered microbiota in obese individuals as well as in subjects with insulin resistance and increase in obesity among individuals exposed to antibiotics during the first year of life.\n\nIt is also consistent with animal models showing that the obese phenotype can be transformed by transplanting \u2018obesity-related bacteria\u2019 or induced by low dose antibiotic.\n\nFuture studies in humans should focus on the changes in microbiota, which are caused by repeated antibiotic exposure; the effect of antibiotic exposure in different age groups; the genetic pathways that are affected by the microbiota; and whether antibiotic administration in diabetic patients might improve glycaemic control.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section Declaration of interest The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest that could be perceived as prejudicing the impartiality of the research

{"content": "AbstractTop of pageAbstractMaterial and MethodsResultsDiscussionAcknowledgementsConflict of InterestsReferencesInappropriate antibiotic use in primary care, such as in respiratory tract infections (RTIs), is an important cause of bacterial resistance.\n\nThis study aimed at describing the current pattern of outpatient antibiotic use in acute RTIs in Spain and evaluating adherence to national recommendations.\n\nA retrospective observational study was performed including all the episodes of RTIs registered during a 1-year period in a north-eastern Spanish region.\n\nData related to patient demography, diagnoses and antibiotic prescriptions were collected from the electronic medical history database in the region, and adherence to recommendations for antibiotic prescribing was assessed.\n\nOne third of patients with a RTI were prescribed an antibiotic, with young adults (aged 15\u201364 years) being the most treated.\n\nHigh prescribing rates were observed in patients with acute otitis, sinusitis and acute tonsillitis (about 70%), whereas low rates were found in acute bronchitis (50%) and non-specific upper RTIs (24%) episodes.\n\nA high prescription of broad-spectrum agents and antibiotics not recommended as first choice was observed.\n\nIn accordance with Spanish guidelines, there exists a potential over-prescribing of antibiotics for all the diagnoses studied, especially in the adult population.\n\nMoreover, the choice of antibiotics is frequently based on agents with a high risk of increasing antimicrobial resistance.\n\nMultifaceted strategies should be implemented to improve the quality of antibiotic prescribing in primary care.Antimicrobial resistance is a major concern to the public health and may result from indiscriminate or poor use of antibiotics [1].Infectious diseases are the most frequent reason for encounter in primary care, and respiratory tract infections (RTIs) account for about two-thirds of all infections seen by the general practitioner (GP) [2].\n\nDespite the fact that the benefit of antimicrobial treatment is rather low [3, 4], a substantial number of patients with RTI are treated with antibiotics [5, 6].\n\nDiagnostic uncertainty characterizes the management of RTIs and doubt about the diagnosis and the aetiology may lead to antibiotic over-prescribing.\n\nOther factors such as patient preferences, fears of getting sued and fear of serious complications may influence the GP's prescribing decision [7].Studies have found a substantial gap between recommendations in evidence-based practice guidelines and doctors' actual prescribing behaviour [8].Compared with other European countries, Spain has historically displayed a high outpatient antibiotic use.\n\nThe majority of antibiotics prescribed are broad-spectrum agents, and there are remarkable seasonal fluctuations reflecting an inappropriate prescribing of antibiotic for RTIs caused by viruses [9].\n\nConsequently, resistance rates of the main respiratory pathogens remain high in Spain, although a decreasing trend has been observed in the last years [10].According to the disease-specific quality indicators for outpatient antibiotic prescribing developed by the European Surveillance Antimicrobial Consumption (ESAC) [11], both the proportion of patients prescribed antibiotics and the choice of antibiotics should be taken into account when evaluating the quality of antibiotic use in general practice.This study aimed at investigating antibiotic prescribing rates and pattern of antibiotic use in patients with RTI in Spain.\n\nWe assessed adherence to national recommendations in order to evaluate the extent of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing.Material and MethodsTop of pageAbstractMaterial and MethodsResultsDiscussionAcknowledgementsConflict of InterestsReferencesArag\u00f3n is an autonomous community located in the north-eastern part of Spain.\n\nIt is constituted by both urban and rural zones and shows a population slightly older than in the country as a whole [12].\n\nThe 17 autonomous communities forming Spain are responsible for the organization and delivery of health services within their community, while the Spanish Ministry of Health has the mandate of playing the core role in the coordination of the National Health Care System.\n\nIn 2010, a number of 1,327,827 inhabitants were covered by the Public Arag\u00f3n Health Service (98.6% of the total population) [12].\n\nThere was a total of 959 GPs in the region, 1230 patients were assigned per GP, and health attendance to children was covered by paediatricians, with about one per 1000 children.\n\nThese numbers were similar to what was reported on average in Spain.\n\nIn addition, there were no important differences regarding the public health expenditure per person or the distribution of primary healthcare resources among Arag\u00f3n and the rest of the Spanish regions [13].This study was carried out based on the database that accumulates electronic medical history data corresponding to all inhabitants insured by the Arag\u00f3n Health Service.\n\nThis database is routinely used by all the GPs in their daily practice and contains diagnoses coded according to the International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) system.\n\nWe selected all records corresponding to patients diagnosed with RTIs from 1 September 2009 to 31 August 2010 and encoded as Acute otitis media (H71), Non-specific upper respiratory tract infection (basically common cold, R74), Sinusitis (R75), Acute tonsillitis (R76) and Acute bronchitis/bronchiolitis (R78).\n\nEach record corresponded to a single episode or diagnosis of RTI and consisted of patient code number, gender, date of birth, ICPC code and Anatomical Therapeutical Classification (ATC) code of all antibiotics prescribed.\n\nA prescription was considered to be associated with an ICPC diagnosis if the prescription was redeemed \u226415 days after the date of the consultation.The total number of episodes and the proportion followed by an antibiotic prescription were calculated by type of diagnosis and age group.\n\nThe pattern of antibiotic prescribing for each of the five diagnoses mentioned above was described.\n\nWe classified antibiotics according to the 2010 version of the World Health Organization ATC/DDD Index [14].The assessment of adherence to national recommendations was based on the Guideline on Antimicrobial Therapy in the Area of Aljarafe [15].\n\nAlthough this guideline is aimed at GPs in a specific health area in Andaluc\u00eda, it is currently the most complete and updated document included in the Clinical Practice Guidelines Index of the National Health System in Spain and applicable to the whole Spanish territory.\n\nThe proportion of appropriate prescriptions was calculated for each RTI diagnosis.ResultsTop of pageAbstractMaterial and MethodsResultsDiscussionAcknowledgementsConflict of InterestsReferencesA total of 320,267 individuals were diagnosed with 520,829 RTI episodes during the study period.\n\nThis corresponded to 241 patients with a RTI per 1000 inhabitants per year.\n\nMean age of patients was 30 years (range 0\u2013107), and 54.5% were men.\n\nTable 1 shows the distribution of RTI diagnoses.\n\nNon-specific upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) was the most frequent diagnosis, representing 72% of the total, whereas <2% was due to sinusitis.Table 1.\n\nRespiratory tract infections in general practice in Arag\u00f3n (Spain): frequency of antibiotic

antibiotic, by type of diagnosis, is shown in table 1.\n\nAntibiotics were prescribed to more than 70% of patients with acute otitis, sinusitis or acute tonsillitis.\n\nHalf of patients with acute bronchitis and a quarter of patients with non-specific URTIs received antibiotics.Highest antibiotic prescribing rate (40%) was found in the age group 15\u201339 years, while <30% of children aged 0\u20134 years received antibiotics (fig.\n\n1).\n\nPatients \u226515 years with non-specific URTI received about twice as much antibiotic than children aged 0\u201314 years.\n\nIndividuals with sinusitis or acute tonsillitis were treated in a similar proportion in all age groups, with percentages slightly higher among the group aged 15\u201364 years.\n\nAbout 70% of adults (15\u201379 years) with acute bronchitis were treated with antibiotics, whereas the percentage of children who received an antibiotic was <30%.\n\nConversely, almost 75% of children diagnosed with acute otitis were prescribed an antibiotic, and the prescribing rate gradually decreased with age until <60% in patients \u226565 years.Figure 1.\n\nFrequency of antibiotic treatment in Respiratory Tract Infections (RTI) according to age group.Download figure to PowerPointThere were significant differences between diagnostic groups regarding the proportion of prescriptions made the same day the patient visited the GP.\n\nSinusitis, acute otitis and acute tonsillitis showed a higher proportion of prescriptions made on the same day (about 92%), while in non-specific URTIs, the proportion was lower (84%).Choice of antibiotics in RTIsWith regard to the type of antibiotic used (fig.\n\n2), amoxicillin was the most commonly prescribed antibiotic in non-specific URTIs (36% of total) and acute tonsillitis (47%).\n\nPatients with acute otitis, sinusitis and acute bronchitis were mainly prescribed combinations of amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid (38%, 37% and 29% of total, respectively).\n\nPrescription of narrow-spectrum penicillin represented 8% of overall antibiotic use in acute tonsillitis.\n\nCephalosporins constituted about 20% of all antibiotic treatments in acute otitis and sinusitis, and macrolides accounted for 32% of total antibiotic use in non-specific URTI.\n\nQuinolones were prescribed to 17% of patients suffering from sinusitis and acute bronchitis.Figure 2.\n\nDistribution of antibiotics prescribed for respiratory tract infections.\n\nNsURTI, Non-specific Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URTI).Download figure to PowerPointAdherence to guidelinesBased on recommendations in the Spanish guidelines (table 2), the antibiotic choice was not appropriate in most of acute otitis: only 33% were treated with amoxicillin, the first-line substance, and almost a quarter conformed to other substances not recommended as first nor second line.\n\nEpisodes of sinusitis were mainly treated with co-amoxiclav, recommended as second choice, while about 70% of episodes of acute tonsillitis were treated with a broad-spectrum penicillin instead of narrow-spectrum penicillin as recommended.\n\nThe choice of antibiotics in bronchitis was conforming to the guidelines in 17% of prescriptions, and the rest of prescriptions deviated from the recommendations.Table 2.\n\nPercentages of episodes treated with first-/second-line antibiotics

contacts caused by a RTI resulted in an antibiotic prescription, with striking variations between different clinical entities and age groups.\n\nIndividuals aged 15\u201364 years were, in general, the most treated (almost 40% received an antibiotic).\n\nNon-specific URTI was the most frequent diagnosis and, although antibiotics are not recommended, 25% resulted in an antibiotic prescription.\n\nAcute otitis, sinusitis and acute tonsillitis were the most common RTIs for which an antibiotic was prescribed.\n\nAntibiotic prescriptions for acute otitis corresponded with recommended first-line substance in 33% of the cases, whereas this percentage was lower in sinusitis (13%) and acute tonsillitis (8%).\n\nHalf of the patients with acute bronchitis were prescribed an antibiotic, and more than 80% received antibiotics not recommended under any condition.Strengths and limitationsTo our knowledge, no observational studies on appropriateness of outpatient RTI treatment in Spain have been published recently, despite the interest and need existing in a country showing high rates of antimicrobial resistance.\n\nOur database covered the whole population in the study area (including children attending paediatricians and patients institutionalized) as well as all GPs; therefore, the obtained results may represent the real practice in the population studied.\n\nNevertheless, the inclusion of such a large number of physicians in studies of these characteristics causes a high variability regarding antimicrobial prescribing, and consequently, a diagnostic bias might have increased the non-compliance of guidelines.Another limitation is related to the uncertainty inherent to RTI diagnoses facing the GP and the difficulty to label a whole of signs and symptoms with a precise ICPC code, which could lead to diagnostic misclassification.\n\nThe relatively recent implementation of electronic history in some Arag\u00f3n healthcare areas could also cause GPs to be untrained and increase the likelihood of unregistered or incorrectly coded cases.Furthermore, it was not possible to discern between multiple prescriptions pertaining to the same diagnosis, which could have increased the risk of incorrect assignment.\n\nHowever, the percentage of study episodes presenting more than one prescription associated was low (6%).We could not consider the possible associated comorbidities, which may influence the prescribing decision and the type of antibiotic used.\n\nFor instance, it is difficult to state whether antibiotics were over-prescribed in some cases of bronchitis, because we did not know the clinical status of the patient.\n\nNevertheless, it is unlikely that the high percentages of patients receiving antibiotics and the frequent choice of substances not recommended as first line could be justified.Comparison with existing literatureVarying percentages of patients with RTIs receiving antibiotic therapy in Spain have previously been reported [2, 5].\n\nLlor et al.\n\n[5], similarly to our findings, showed higher proportions of acute tonsillitis, sinusitis and acute otitis episodes being treated in Spanish primary health care compared with acute bronchitis and non-specific URTI episodes.\n\nThe highest rates of antibiotic prescribing in our study population were found for young adults (aged 15\u201364 years).\n\nThis fact had already been reported in previous studies performed in different countries [8, 16] and could be explained by their situation as people in employment attending the outpatient clinic, presenting serious symptoms and demanding antibiotics to ensure a rapid recovery.Our results displayed a high percentage of patients with acute otitis apparently treated to an unjustified extent, because most cases of otitis in older children and adults are self-limited and spontaneously remit with no complications.\n\nAlthough antibiotics have been found to shorten the duration of acute otitis episodes and reduce the risk of complications, the number of patients needed to be treated (NNT) in order to prevent one serious complication is extremely high, that is over 4000 [3, 4].Potential antibiotic over-prescribing for sinusitis was also observed in our study, with more than 70% of episodes being treated but this is a global problem.\n\nA recent study performed in six countries also showed high rates of antibiotic prescribing in patients with acute sinusitis, ranging from 56% to 87% [6].\n\nAbout 80% of sinusitis have a viral aetiology, and only a very small percentage is complicated by bacterial infection [15].\n\nMoreover, current guidelines only advise antibiotics in severe cases of bacterial sinusitis, supported by an increased C-reactive protein (CRP).\n\nCRP is a rapid diagnostic test that helps physicians to discern between a bacterial or viral infection in suspected sinusitis.\n\nAlthough the latter has been shown as a useful strategy to decrease antibiotic prescription and also increase patient satisfaction [17], it is not routinely used in Spanish primary health care, and GPs have to make a decision only based on the clinical history of the patient and the physical examination.Although streptococcal tonsillitis represents about 10\u201330% of all cases of acute tonsillitis [18], the proportion of patients treated with antibiotics was higher than 60% in all age groups.\n\nAntibiotic use in acute tonsillitis is based on a clinical evaluation and should only be considered if a bacterial cause is highly probable [3].\n\nMost Spanish GPs do not have access to rapid antigen detection tests that significantly reduce prescription of antibiotics and must base the diagnoses on the Centor Criteria that have not shown to be useful in decreasing antibiotic prescribing [18].Concerning non-specific URTI diagnosis, antibiotics were over-prescribed in all cases, because these conditions are usually viral and self-limited and no antibiotics are indicated.\n\nMoreover, 16% of antibiotic prescriptions were issued on a different date than the diagnosis.\n\nIn view of this, a delayed prescription could have been an effective means to reduce inappropriate antibiotic prescribing [3] but its use is not widespread in Spain.With regard to episodes of acute bronchitis, half of the patients with this condition were prescribed an antibiotic although antibiotics have only shown a limited effect in the recovery [4].\n\nIn the presence of a patient with chest infection, GPs face the difficulty in distinguishing between acute bronchitis, for which antibiotics are not recommended, and early pneumonia, for which they are recommended.\n\nChest radiography can be used to distinguish acute bronchitis from pneumonia but is not readily available in primary care, which probably makes GPs overestimate the risk of pneumonia and unnecessarily increase antibiotic prescribing [4].\n\nIn fact, most of the incorrectly prescribed substances for bronchitis episodes (amoxicillin, co-amoxiclav or quinolones) are recommended in the treatment of pneumonia.\n\nGuidelines suggest prescription of antibiotics in patients with certain chronic conditions or immunodepressed patients, so higher rates of use would be expected in the elderly.\n\nNevertheless, the proportion of patients with acute bronchitis treated in Arag\u00f3n was lower in the elderly (\u226580 years) than in younger adults, probably because people in employment require a faster recovery.A high use of agents not recommended as first choice was exhibited.\n\nTwo similar studies carried out in the Netherlands [16] and Ireland [8] showed also an inadequate compliance to national guidelines, although, especially in the Netherlands, antibiotic prescribing was more appropriate.\n\nCo-amoxiclav represented a great proportion of total prescribing in the Spanish region, despite not being advised as first choice for any condition.\n\nThis substance has been broadly used in Spain during the last years [2, 19].\n\nAbout 75% of cases of acute tonsillitis received a prescription of amoxicillin or co-amoxiclav, in contrast to 8% receiving penicillin V, a narrow-spectrum penicillin recommended as first choice for acute tonsillitis caused by GABHS.\n\nThe limited number of commercial forms in which penicillin V can be found in Spain, and the absence of prescribing habits among GPs regarding penicillin V could explain the lower prescribing rate of penicillin V, which has a major impact on increasing resistance.In general terms, adherence to Spanish current guidelines was low.\n\nOver-prescribing and inappropriate choice of antibiotics seem to be due to lack of education, training and habits.\n\nOn the one hand, physicians must daily deal with the uncertainty that characterizes acute RTIs, with the frequent lack of rapid diagnostic tests or with the absence of time to show the patient/parents the reasons for not prescribing an antibiotic.\n\nThese conditions could explain, in part, the incorrect decision of prescribing.\n\nOn the other hand, habits regarding use of antibiotics in the Spanish population have probably been influenced by facts such as traditional high rates of antibiotic prescribing [19], the easiness to obtain an antibiotic without prescription in Spanish pharmacies until recently [20] or the presence of antibiotic leftovers in most of Spanish households.\n\nA study performed in Spain a few years ago showed a percentage of antibiotics self-administered for RTIs greater than the percentage of prescriptions made by GPs for these processes [20].Implications for clinical practiceIn view of the lack of compliance of the current guidelines, urgent measures should be implemented.\n\nClinical guidelines are designed considering the resistance pattern existing in a region and also other factors such as market availability or the characteristics of the population.\n\nGPs should be aware of their utility to orientate their clinical decisions, especially if these are combined with rapid diagnostic tests available in the consultations.\n\nGPs should also recognize the importance of patient adherence to treatment regarding health outcome [21].The Happy Audit project performed an intervention in different countries, as Spain, aimed at improving training and knowledge regarding appropriate antibiotic use in RTIs in both GPs and patients, and focused on improving diagnostic procedures as well.\n\nThis multifaceted intervention programme led to a marked reduction in antibiotic prescribing and an improvement in the choice of antibiotic in RTIs [22].\n\nTherefore, a starting point when trying to modify practices as described in Spain could be the performance of audits followed by relevant interventions to improve the quality of antibiotic prescribing.Prescribing quality will be reached when public awareness about appropriate antibiotic use will increase, and a higher number of resources and efforts are aimed at reducing the risk of bacterial resistance.AcknowledgementsTop of pageAbstractMaterial and MethodsResultsDiscussionAcknowledgementsConflict of InterestsReferencesThis

L.\n\nFergusona and David W.\n\nThomasa aAdvanced Therapies Group, School of Dentistry, Cardiff University, Heath Park, Cardiff, United Kingdom bThe Welsh Centre for Burns and Plastic Surgery, Morriston Hospital, Swansea, United Kingdom Next Section ABSTRACT This study describes the use of a novel, two-compartment, static dialysis bag model to study the release, diffusion, and antibacterial activity of a novel, bioresponsive dextrin-colistin polymer conjugate against multidrug resistant (MDR) wild-type Acinetobacter baumannii.\n\nIn this model, colistin sulfate, at its MIC, produced a rapid and extensive drop in viable bacterial counts (<2 log10 CFU/ml at 4 h); however, a marked recovery was observed thereafter, with regrowth equivalent to that of control by 48 h.\n\nIn contrast, dextrin-colistin conjugate, at its MIC, suppressed bacterial growth for up to 48 h, with 3 log10 CFU/ml lower bacterial counts after 48 h than those of controls.\n\nDoubling the concentration of dextrin-colistin conjugate (to 2\u00d7 MIC) led to an initial bacterial killing of 3 log10 CFU/ml at 8 h, with a similar regrowth profile to 1\u00d7 MIC treatment thereafter.\n\nThe addition of colistin sulfate (1\u00d7 MIC) to dextrin-colistin conjugate (1\u00d7 MIC) resulted in undetectable bacterial counts after 4 h, followed by suppressed bacterial growth (3.5 log10 CFU/ml lower than that of control at 48 h).\n\nIncubation of dextrin-colistin conjugates with infected wound exudate from a series of burn patients (n = 6) revealed an increasing concentration of unmasked colistin in the outer compartment (OC) over time (up to 86.3% of the initial dose at 48 h), confirming that colistin would be liberated from the conjugate by endogenous \u03b1-amylase within the wound environment.\n\nThese studies confirm the utility of this model system to simulate the pharmacokinetics of colistin formation in humans administered dextrin-colistin conjugates and further supports the development of antibiotic polymer conjugates in the treatment of MDR infections.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section INTRODUCTION In an attempt to meet the challenge of the global epidemic of antibiotic-resistant infections, treatment strategies are increasingly employing nanomedicine-based approaches, which have been used in the treatment of a number of human diseases with considerable success (1, 2).\n\nThe adoption of these approaches as antimicrobial therapies has seen the preclinical development of novel agents, including antibiotic-bearing nanoparticles, liposomes, dendrimers, and polymer therapeutics (3, 4).\n\nThese agents may offer potential benefits over conventional systemic delivery in minimizing toxicity and overcoming drug resistance by affording selective targeting of systemically delivered antibiotics to sites of infection and inflammation, thus maximizing local bioavailability of the chemotherapeutic agent (3, 5).\n\nThe employment of polymer therapeutics, in which an antibiotic is covalently attached to a water-soluble polymer, may afford a number of important practical advantages, including increased solubility and bioavailability, decreased toxicity, and a chemically modifiable controlled-release system that can be truly customized (2, 4, 6).\n\nIn this respect, we recently described a nanoantibiotic polymer therapeutic, based on dextrin conjugated to colistin, whereby colistin is controllably released from the conjugate by amylase-triggered degradation of dextrin, according to the polymer masked-unmasked protein therapy (PUMPT) principle (7), and in so doing, reinstates the antibiotic activity of colistin (8, 9).\n\nThese dextrin-colistin conjugates demonstrated antibacterial activity across a range of Gram-negative bacteria that was comparable to colistin methanesulfonate (CMS) but exhibited reduced in vitro and in vivo toxicity and prolonged plasma half-life.\n\nIn the preliminary design and development of any novel chemical entity, it is pivotally important to understand its pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) profile before moving to in vivo efficacy studies.\n\nThis is particularly important in nanoantibiotic delivery systems, as the incorporation of conventional small molecules into nano-sized structures is associated with PK/PD properties that are substantially altered from the original antibiotic (10, 11).\n\nHowever, the complex release or formation of drug from nanoantibiotics renders conventional PK/PD models inappropriate in the preclinical development of these controlled-release systems (10, 11).\n\nConventional single-compartment static models, while extensively utilized to study the effect of fixed antibiotic doses on fixed bacterial loads (12, 13), are typically viable for only \u226424 h (14, 15) and are of limited value in investigating drug release and the real-time antimicrobial effects of controlled-release drugs (16, 17).\n\nSingle-compartment time-to-kill (TTK) models are also unable to prevent denaturation of the macromolecule's activating enzyme (e.g., \u03b1-amylase) by artificial media used to sustain bacterial growth (16, 17).\n\nMultiple-chamber dynamic models may be used to produce concentration gradients, although they require considerable technical expertise and specialist software and are associated with high costs (18).\n\nIn the development and screening of nanoantibiotics, a need thus exists for a suitable in vitro model to define the PK/PD profiles and optimize the characteristics of these novel agents prior to in vivo testing.\n\nThis study employed dextrin-colistin conjugates as prototypical nanoantibiotics to develop a model system which would afford the opportunity to study the in vitro degradation, diffusion, and activation of the conjugate alone and in the presence of amylase or infected wound fluid.\n\nThe study sought to define an in vitro model in which the PK/PD parameters of biodegradable antibiotic polymer conjugates can be reliably assessed.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials.Colistin sulfate, ethanol, human salivary \u03b1-amylase, 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP), anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), succinic anhydride, diethyl ether, type 1 dextrin from cornstarch (molecular weight, \u223c8,100 g/mol), and carbonic anhydrase (molecular weight, 29,000 g/mol) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Poole, United Kingdom).\n\nSodium hydrogen orthophosphate, potassium dihydrogen orthophosphate, potassium chloride, sodium hydroxide (NaOH), copper (II) sulfate pentahydrate, bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay kit, and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Loughborough, United Kingdom).\n\nSterile 0.9% sodium chloride solution was obtained from Baxter (Berkshire, United Kingdom).\n\nN-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (sulfo-NHS) was purchased from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland).\n\nTrypticase soy agar (TSA), Trypticase soy broth (TSB), and cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth (CAMHB, lot 43145) were purchased from Oxoid (Basingstoke, United Kingdom).\n\nPolyvinylidene fluoride sterile membrane syringe filters (0.22 \u03bcm) were from Elkay (Basingstoke, United Kingdom).\n\nTegaderm semipermeable dressings were purchased from 3M Healthcare (Neuss, Germany).\n\nSterile graduated plastic syringes were from BD Plastipak (Madrid, Spain).\n\nThe Phadebas amylase test was from Magle Life Sciences (Lund, Sweden), and the MaxSignal colistin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit was purchased from Bioo Scientific Corp.\n\n(Austin, TX, USA).\n\nAll chemicals were of analytical grade.\n\nEscherichia coli (E.\n\ncoli) National Collection of Type Cultures (NCTC) 10418 and Acinetobacter baumannii 7789 (v19) from clinically infected wounds (19) were donated by R.\n\nHowe (Public Health Wales Microbiology Laboratory, University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, United Kingdom).\n\nThe sensitivities of these strains were reported previously (19).\n\nMIC values of A.\n\nbaumannii 7789 were previously reported as 0.0625 and 8 \u03bcg/ml for colistin sulfate and dextrin-colistin conjugate (plus amylase), respectively (20).\n\nSynthesis and characterization of dextrin-colistin conjugates.Dextrin-colistin conjugates were synthesized and characterized as previously described (8, 9).\n\nThe dextrin-colistin conjugate used in these studies contained dextrin with 1.0 mol% succinoylation and had a molecular weight of \u223c10,300 g/mol (gel permeation chromatography [GPC] with pullulan standards) and a colistin content of 11.2% wt/wt (BCA assay) with <3% free colistin (fast protein liquid chromatography [FPLC]).\n\nIn vitro PK/PD model.The unmasking of dextrin-colistin conjugates was simulated using a two-compartment static dialysis bag model under sink conditions (total volume, 20 ml; inner-compartment volume, 5 ml), as shown schematically in Fig.\n\n1.\n\nDialysis membrane (10,000 g/mol molecular weight cutoff [MWCO]) was presoaked for 15 to 30 min in distilled water (dH2O), secured with dialysis clips, and suspended from an injection port to separate the inner compartment (IC) from the outer compartment (OC) in a sterilized 25-ml beaker sealed with a sterile medical-grade polyurethane membrane (Tegaderm).\n\nThe model system was prepared under aseptic conditions in a class 2 laminar airflow cabinet and transferred to a shaking incubator set at 37\u00b0C in ambient air and constant orbital agitation at 70 rpm for 48 h.\n\nView larger version: In this window In a new window Download as PowerPoint Slide FIG 1 Schematic illustration of the two-compartment static dialysis bag PK/PD model under infinite sink conditions (a) and the hypothesized distribution of dextrin-colistin conjugates (b).\n\nValidation of in vitro PK/PD model.To validate the ability of the dialysis membrane to retain intact dextrin-colistin conjugate in the IC while permitting unrestricted diffusion of unmasked colistin to the OC, the protein content in both compartments was measured over time.\n\nBriefly, the IC was spiked with dextrin-colistin conjugate (equivalent to 10 \u03bcg/ml colistin) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4, 37\u00b0C) in the absence and presence of \u03b1-amylase (100 IU/liter), while the OC contained sterile PBS (15 ml).\n\nThe sealed beaker was incubated as described previously.\n\nSamples (150 \u03bcl) were extracted from each compartment at various intervals (0, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h) using sterile, medical-grade, single-use vascular catheters and immediately frozen on dry ice and stored at \u221220\u00b0C prior to analysis.\n\nProtein content was determined using a standard BCA assay, and the antimicrobial susceptibility of E.\n\ncoli NCTC 10418 isolates was assessed using an MIC assay (see below).\n\nAt the end of the 48 h of incubation, FPLC was used to estimate the proportion of unmasked colistin in both compartments by calculating the area under the chromatographic curve.\n\nAt the end of the experiment, the integrity of the dialysis membrane to \u03b1-amylase was confirmed using carbonic anhydrase as a molecular weight marker.\n\nThe contents of both the IC and OC were removed.\n\nThe dialysis membrane was flushed with several volumes of sterile dH2O and then resuspended in sterile PBS as described previously.\n\nThe IC was spiked with carbonic anhydrase (2 \u03bcg/ml) in PBS.\n\nAfter a further 17 h of incubation with PBS in the OC, the ratio of carbonic anhydrase in both compartments was quantified by UV-visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometry (n = 3).\n\nSusceptibility testing.Antimicrobial activity in the OC was measured in E.\n\ncoli NCTC 10418 isolates in a standard MIC assay (21).\n\nIsolates were grown overnight in TSB and then diluted in sterile PBS to an optical density at 625 nm (OD625) of between 0.08 and 0.10 (equivalent to 0.5 McFarland standard; \u223c108 CFU/ml).\n\nSerial 2-fold dilutions were prepared for each sample in flat-bottom 96-well microtiter plates (100 \u03bcl/well).\n\nThe diluted bacterial cultures were then diluted 10-fold in CAMHB, and 5 \u03bcl was added to each well of the microtiter plate.\n\nPlates were incubated at 37\u00b0C in ambient air for 18 to 20 h, and the lowest concentration at which there was no visible growth was taken as the MIC.\n\nIn addition, on each plate, triplicate wells were prepared containing no antibiotic and no bacterial inoculum as growth and sterility controls, respectively.\n\nTime-to-kill assay.A modified TTK assay was used to investigate the concentration- and time-dependent antimicrobial activity of colistin sulfate, dextrin-colistin conjugate, and a mixture of colistin sulfate plus dextrin-colistin conjugate against A.\n\nbaumannii 7789.\n\nIn these experiments, the OC contained \u223c5 log10 CFU/ml of A.\n\nbaumannii 7789 in MHB, and the IC contained \u03b1-amylase (100 IU/liter) in sterile PBS in combination with (i) colistin sulfate (0.25 \u03bcg/ml, 1\u00d7 MIC), (ii) dextrin-colistin conjugate (32 \u03bcg/ml colistin equivalent, 1\u00d7 MIC), (iii) dextrin-colistin conjugate (64 \u03bcg/ml colistin equivalent, 2\u00d7 MIC), or (iv) a mixture of colistin sulfate (0.25 \u03bcg/ml, 1\u00d7 MIC) and dextrin-colistin conjugate (32 \u03bcg/ml colistin equivalent, 1\u00d7 MIC).\n\nColony counts (CFU/ml) from samples taken as described previously were performed in triplicate according to the method of Miles et al.\n\n(22).\n\nBriefly, samples (50 \u03bcl) were diluted 10-fold in PBS and centrifuged.\n\nPellets were resuspended in an equivalent volume of fresh PBS.\n\nSerial 10-fold dilutions were performed in triplicate across a 96-well plate.\n\nSamples (5 \u03bcl) from each dilution were dropped onto the surface of the dried TSA plates in triplicate.\n\nThe TSA plates were left undisturbed for 30 min, inverted, incubated for 18 to 20 h (37\u00b0C in ambient air), and then visually inspected for growth.\n\nThe drop position displaying the highest number of full-size discrete colonies (range, 2 to 20 colonies) was quantified and multiplied by the dilution factor.\n\nThe resulting colony count (CFU/ml) was plotted versus the time to produce a TTK curve.\n\nGrowth and sterility controls in the absence of antibiotic or A.\n\nbaumannii 7789, respectively, were performed in triplicate.\n\nEx vivo sample collection.Following research ethics committee approval and informed consent, wound fluid samples were collected from adult infected burn wounds (n = 6) being treated at the Welsh Burns Centre (Swansea, United Kingdom).\n\nBurn wound infection was diagnosed according to the American Burn Association diagnostic criteria (23).\n\nPatients with recorded pancreatic or salivary disease were excluded.\n\nAfter dressing removal, the wounds were lightly washed with sterile 0.9% sodium chloride solution, and a sterile Teak graft board was used to collect the exudate.\n\nSamples were then transferred to a sterile syringe, sealed, frozen on dry ice, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until required.\n\nSamples were centrifuged (15,000 \u00d7 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C), and then the \u03b1-amylase content was determined in triplicate using a Phadebas amylase test according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nIn vitro modeling of dextrin-colistin conjugate unmasking in infected wound fluid.The same PK/PD setup was used to evaluate the feasibility of dextrin-colistin conjugate unmasking in infected burn wound samples.\n\nEach wound fluid sample was diluted 2-fold in PBS to make up the IC volume (5 ml), and dextrin-colistin conjugate (64 \u03bcg/ml colistin equivalent, 2\u00d7 MIC) was added.\n\nFor each wound sample, the procedure was repeated in triplicate.\n\nTotal colistin content in the OC was quantified by ELISA according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nAbsorbance was measured at 450 nm using a microtiter plate reader, and these values were used to calculate the colistin concentration in the OC (mean \u00b1 standard deviation [SD], n = 3) according to the calibration curve (assay detection range, 0.5 to 50 ng/ml).\n\nThe proportion of unmasked conjugate in the OC was calculated using FPLC, as previously described.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section RESULTS Method validation.Protein concentration in the IC decreased in a logarithmic fashion over time, while protein concentration in the OC increased reciprocally (Fig.\n\n2).\n\nA corresponding increase in antimicrobial activity of the OC over the 48 h of incubation was also observed (Fig.\n\n2).\n\nFPLC demonstrated that by 48 h, significant unmasking had occurred (P < 0.05), with unmasked conjugate accounting for \u223c68% of total colistin content in the system (Fig.\n\n3).\n\nAt 48 h, there was no significant difference in the distribution of unmasked conjugate between the two compartments (P > 0.05).\n\nCorrespondingly, there was a significantly higher proportion of high-molecular-weight (masked) dextrin-colistin conjugate in the IC (\u223c80%; P < 0.05) than in the OC (Fig.\n\n3b).\n\nWhen the experiment was conducted using dextrin-colistin conjugate in the absence of \u03b1-amylase, the OC protein content was <10% after 17 h.\n\nMembrane integrity testing confirmed that the presence of carbonic anhydrase in the OC was always below the lower limit of quantification (data not shown).\n\nView larger version: In this window In a new window Download as PowerPoint Slide FIG 2 Distribution and antimicrobial activity of dextrin-colistin

the assay's lower limit of quantification at 4 h.\n\nHowever, early and significant bacterial regrowth, to the level seen for controls, was observed from 8 h on (Fig.\n\n4).\n\nDextrin-colistin conjugate was bactericidal at 2\u00d7 MIC, where the maximum reduction in viable bacterial counts (\u223c3 log10 CFU/ml) occurred at 8 h.\n\nThereafter, regrowth was slower than in the presence of colistin sulfate.\n\nIn contrast, the colistin sulfate plus dextrin-colistin conjugate combination retained optimal characteristics of both components, with rapid initial bacterial killing, maximum reduction in viable bacterial counts at 4 h, and sustained reduction in viable bacteria throughout the experiment.\n\nThe control growth curves confirmed that bacterial growth can be maintained under

model under infinite sink conditions would offer a simple and cost-effective method for the initial PK/PD characterization of biodegradable antibiotic polymer conjugates.\n\nUsing dextrin-colistin conjugate, we showed that the model can be employed to study degradation, diffusion, and activity across a biological membrane.\n\nMoreover, we demonstrated how these processes may be modified by local enzyme activity at sites of infection.\n\nThe use of a two-compartment system permitted the discrete sampling and detailed analysis of the individual compartments over time.\n\nFurthermore, this model enabled the composition of the two compartments to be modified to represent the environmental conditions of the disease of interest, as demonstrated here using simulated and real biological fluids containing physiological concentrations of \u03b1-amylase.\n\nThe ex vivo model described here can easily be adapted to allow modeling of disease- and target site-specific levels of enzymatic activity in the assessment of enzyme-triggered pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics using alternative biological fluids (e.g., wound fluid or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid).\n\nThe model utilized Spectra/POR 7 membrane to prevent nonspecific drug binding to the membrane and heavy metal contamination (24\u201326).\n\nThe MWCO of the dialysis membrane serves as a size exclusion barrier and can be selected according to the molecular weight of the drug carrier, antibiotic, or activating enzyme.\n\nThus, the dialysis membrane can also effectively prevent premature denaturation of the activating enzyme by artificial media in the OC.\n\nThe dextrin-colistin conjugates studied here were activated by \u03b1-amylase\u2013mediated degradation of dextrin, resulting in a reduction in its molecular weight and diffusion of the unmasked conjugate along a concentration gradient to the OC (Fig.\n\n1), where bioactivity can be assayed under various conditions.\n\nIn this regard, an IC-to-OC ratio of 1:4 vol/vol and a total volume of 20 ml in the system maintained infinite sink conditions, provided a concentration gradient, and prevented OC saturation with unmasked conjugate.\n\nThe infinite sink strategy presented a convenient, cost-effective means of controlling localized drug concentrations (18, 27) and monitoring drug activation in the IC and the resulting bioactivity in the OC.\n\nConsidering the controlled-release nature of the dextrin-colistin conjugate, it was essential to provide an incubation environment that resembled in vivo conditions, while ensuring bacterial viability.\n\nTherefore, 37\u00b0C was selected to mimic in vivo conditions; constant agitation reduced the risk of boundary-layer effects at the dialysis membrane (27) and contributed to the maintenance of bacterial growth.\n\nIndeed, this two-compartment model demonstrated colistin sulfate's rapid bacterial killing and the subsequent bacterial regrowth observed in previously validated one-compartment models (28\u201330).\n\nThe ability of the dialysis membrane to retain the intact conjugate within the IC until it is unmasked was confirmed during validation, where, in the absence of \u03b1-amylase, OC protein content remained at <10% at 17 h.\n\nThe addition of \u03b1-amylase led to increases in the protein content and antimicrobial activity of the OC, which were mirrored by decreased bacterial counts in the TTK study and were in agreement with previous in vitro physicochemical data (8, 9).\n\nThe analysis of bacterial counts in the presence of colistin sulfate was interesting and showed that bacterial recovery occurred earlier than the shortest currently recommended dosing interval for colistin (31, 32), demonstrating the clinical benefit that these models may offer.\n\nIn contrast, with the dextrin-colistin conjugates, the recovery of bacterial counts was significantly delayed, presumably due to the sustained release of colistin from dextrin-colistin conjugates by \u03b1-amylase.\n\nSince colistin is a concentration-dependent antibiotic (33) with a modest postantibiotic effect (34), the ability of the polymer conjugates to prolong exposure of bacteria to colistin may be more beneficial to antibacterial efficacy than the achievement of high peak concentrations (25, 35, 36).\n\nSeveral concentration-dependent antibiotics, including azithromycin, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin, have been incorporated into controlled-release polymeric carriers, such as nanoparticles and liposomes (37\u201339), which can readily be tested in our in vitro system.\n\nFor instance, Wang et al.\n\n(40) used a similar two-compartment model to characterize the in vitro release kinetics of colistin sulfate-loaded liposomes.\n\nIn this study, a combination of colistin sulfate and dextrin-colistin conjugate provided a rapid decline in viable counts, followed by a sustained suppression of bacterial growth rate.\n\nThe conjugate unmasking by \u03b1-amylase was shown to be time dependent, meaning that in clinical use, administration of an initial dose of conventional antibiotic may be required when treating acute disease.\n\nIn addition to improving the therapeutic efficacy of nanoformulated drugs, incorporating antibiotics into nano-sized structures also converts conventional small-molecule antibiotics into macromolecules, which may benefit from passive size-based targeting and accumulation at sites of inflammation/infection via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect (4, 41).\n\nA potential limitation of this model is its inability to replicate the potential benefits of the EPR effect, representing an avenue for future development.\n\nModification of the IC to incubate dextrin-colistin conjugate directly in ex vivo infected wound fluid represented an adaptation of the PK/PD model to a higher level of complexity to enable ex vivo testing.\n\nIn these studies, the \u03b1-amylase concentration in burn wound fluid was markedly higher than that in plasma.\n\nThese results cannot be simply explained by the effects of thermal injury, as the mean time of sample collection was >2 weeks postburn, when vascular permeability and interstitial fluid leakage have largely subsided (42, 43).\n\nIncubation of dextrin-colistin conjugates in infected wound fluid demonstrated that colistin would be readily released from the conjugate locally at infected sites due to local \u03b1-amylase activity.\n\nThe conjugate unmasking rate (68.1% to 86.2% at 48 h) compared favorably to published values for CMS, for which conversion to colistin in ex vivo human plasma samples after 48 h was \u223c60% (44).\n\nRecent advances in the design and development of nanoantibiotics, with complex drug-release profiles, warrant the establishment of a novel PK/PD model for monitoring their drug release and antibiotic efficacy.\n\nThis two-compartment model system permits the building in of increasing levels of complexity, providing a versatile tool to describe the effect of bioresponsive dextrin-colistin conjugates by characterization of in vitro drug release (in simulated and ex vivo biological fluids) and bacterial killing over time.\n\nIt is anticipated that these results will assist in designing optimal dosing strategies for dextrin-colistin conjugates in vivo.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Central.\n\n2015Received: 26 February 2015Accepted: 10 April 2015Published: 4 May 2015 Abstract Introduction The objective of this work was to investigate the risk factors for the acquisition of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and its resistance phenotypes in critically ill patients, taking into account colonization pressure.\n\nMethods We conducted a prospective cohort study in an 8-bed medical intensive care unit during a 35-month period.\n\nNasopharyngeal and rectal swabs and respiratory secretions were obtained within 48 hours of admission and thrice weekly thereafter.\n\nDuring the study, a policy of consecutive mixing and cycling periods of three classes of antipseudomonal antibiotics was followed in the unit.\n\nResults Of 850 patients admitted for \u22653 days, 751 (88.3%) received an antibiotic, 562 of which (66.1%) were antipseudomonal antibiotics.\n\nA total of 68 patients (8%) carried P.\n\naeruginosa upon admission, and among the remaining 782, 104 (13%) acquired at least one strain of P.\n\naeruginosa during their stay.\n\nMultivariate analysis selected shock (odds ratio (OR) =2.1; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.2 to 3.7), intubation (OR =3.6; 95% CI, 1.7 to 7.5), enteral nutrition (OR =3.6; 95% CI, 1.8 to 7.6), parenteral nutrition (OR =3.9; 95% CI, 1.6 to 9.6), tracheostomy (OR =4.4; 95% CI, 2.3 to 8.3) and colonization pressure >0.43 (OR =4; 95% CI, 1.2 to 5) as independently associated with the acquisition of P.\n\naeruginosa, whereas exposure to fluoroquinolones for >3 days (OR =0.4; 95% CI, 0.2 to 0.8) was protective.\n\nIn the whole series, prior exposure to carbapenems was independently associated with carbapenem resistance, and prior amikacin use predicted piperacillin-tazobactam, fluoroquinolone and multiple-drug resistance.\n\nConclusions In critical care settings with a high rate of antibiotic use, colonization pressure and non-antibiotic exposures may be the crucial factors for P.\n\naeruginosa acquisition, whereas fluoroquinolones may actually decrease its likelihood.\n\nFor the acquisition of strains resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam, fluoroquinolones and multiple drugs, exposure to amikacin may be more relevant than previously recognized.\n\nIntroductionPrevious exposure to antibiotics is considered an imperative risk factor for the acquisition of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the subsequent development of infection [1].\n\nAccording to the classical paradigm, non-antipseudomonal agents would promote acquisition of any P.\n\naeruginosa strain [2,3], whereas drugs with antipseudomonal activity would select those resistant to the particular class of antimicrobial drug used [4].\n\nResistance acquisition driven by exposure to antipseudomonal agents can be reached by either selecting mutants in patients previously colonized or infected by susceptible phenotypes [5,6] or promoting selection of an already resistant strain [7].\n\nMany study researchers have reported that prior exposure to a given antipseudomonal agent is associated with the acquisition of strains resistant to it [4,8-16], to unrelated agents [8-10,14,17-20] or to multiple drugs [13,21-27].\n\nHowever, not enough data have been provided to ascertain which of the above-mentioned processes is preferentially involved [26,28].There are discrepancies regarding the magnitude of the risk of resistance acquisition associated with the different antipseudomonal agents.\n\nIn patients previously colonized or infected by P.\n\naeruginosa, carbapenems and fluoroquinolones may have a greater tendency to select resistant mutants than other agents [5,6,29,30].\n\nIn addition, prior exposure to fluoroquinolones or carbapenems has commonly been associated with the acquisition of strains resistant to unrelated antibiotics and multiple drugs [10,15,17-22,24,26,31].\n\nHowever, there are some exceptions.\n\nIn a case\u2013control study [24], cephalosporins and aminoglycosides (but not quinolones) were the main predictors of a multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype, and, in a cohort study [28], quinolones were protective against the acquisition of P.\n\naeruginosa and had no role in the acquisition of resistant phenotypes.Part of the discrepancies among studies regarding the role of previous use of antibiotics on P.\n\naeruginosa resistance may be due to local differences in transmission rates, because exposure to antipseudomonal agents in previously non-colonized patients necessarily requires transmission from other patients or environmental sources to foster the acquisition of resistant strains.\n\nHowever, variables influencing transmission, such as colonization pressure [32], have rarely been taken into account in studies aimed at defining the influence of antibiotics on the acquisition of any P.\n\naeruginosa or of strains with specific resistance phenotypes [2,3,14,33].\n\nAn accurate picture of the most meaningful epidemiological and exposure variables is essential to designing effective control measures directed at curbing the increasing incidence of the resistance of this important pathogen.During a 3-year period, we were able to systematically obtain multisite surveillance cultures from patients admitted to a medical intensive care unit (ICU).\n\nThis allowed us to investigate in detail the factors associated with the acquisition of P.\n\naeruginosa and its different resistance phenotypes, taking into account both significant exposures (including antibiotics) and colonization pressure.\n\nMaterials and methods Study population From February 2006 to December 2008, all patients admitted to an 8-bed adult medical ICU of a 700-bed university hospital who stayed in the unit for at least 3 days (72 hours) were prospectively included in the study.\n\nThe study unit has two individual rooms and a central space with six cubicles, and it is the reference unit for critically ill medical patients from the internal medicine, haematology, oncology and infectious diseases wards.\n\nAfter a previous pilot experience [34], the director of the study unit decided to implement a mixing and cycling strategy of antibiotic use on a regular basis.\n\nTo evaluate this policy, a prospective study of systematic screening for the detection of resistant or potentially resistant microorganisms was carried out during the first 3 years of its implementation.\n\nThe present study was an analysis using clinical and microbiological data collected during the prospective screening program with the aim of investigating the risk factors for P.\n\naeruginosa acquisition.\n\nThe study protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the University Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, which waived the requirement of informed consent (approval reference number 2616).\n\nMicrobiological procedures Swabbing of nares, pharynx and rectum, as well as respiratory secretions (tracheobronchial aspirate, bronchoscopic samples or sputum), were obtained within 48 hours of admission and thrice weekly thereafter until discharge or the first 2 months of the ICU stay.\n\nOther clinical samples were obtained as deemed necessary by the attending physician.\n\nSamples were cultured in conventional agar media.\n\nNo environmental cultures were taken.\n\nSusceptibility testing was done by using a microdilution technique according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines [35].\n\nFor the purpose of analysis, intermediate susceptibility was considered as resistance.\n\nMolecular typing was performed by pulse-field gel electrophoresis as previously described [36].\n\nResistance to multiple antibiotics was defined as MDR, extensively drug-resistant (XDR) or pandrug-resistant (PDR) as described elsewhere [37].\n\nClinical variables Demographics, clinical variables, severity scores (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)) upon admission and exposures during ICU stay were prospectively collected from all admitted patients as previously described.\n\nThese data are shown in Table 1 [34].Table 1 Patient

variables as mean (standard deviation).\n\nAntibiotic use For the duration of the study, a policy of consecutive mixing and cycling periods of three classes of antipseudomonal agents (meropenem, ceftazidime/piperacillin-tazobactam and ciprofloxacin/levofloxacin) was implemented in the study unit.\n\nEach period lasted 4.5 months.\n\nDuring mixing, a different antipseudomonal antibiotic class was prescribed to each consecutive patient.\n\nCycling periods were divided in three consecutive 6-week intervals in which a different antibiotic class was given to every patient.\n\nThe decision to provide antipseudomonal antibiotics was made by the attending physician based on clinical judgment.\n\nAmikacin in a once-daily dose was the aminoglycoside favoured for antipseudomonal antibiotic coverage, but its administration as monotherapy or for >5 days was discouraged.\n\nThe decision to administer combination treatment with a \u03b2-lactam and a fluoroquinolone or amikacin was also made by the attending physician, and, in accordance with current protocols, it was encouraged only for patients with severe sepsis or septic shock.\n\nEpidemiological variables The results of surveillance cultures were communicated to the attending physician either when they yielded a microorganism requiring contact precautions according to current isolation practices in the hospital (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA); vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE); enteric Gram-negative bacilli producing extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamases; P.\n\naeruginosa resistant to at least three classes of antipseudomonal agents, considering ceftazidime and piperacillin-tazobactam or ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin as single classes) or when an outbreak was suspected.\n\nContact precautions implied the transfer to an individual room when available and, in any case, the wearing of gowns and gloves when entering the cubicle or room.\n\nPatients with prior MRSA, MDR Gram-negative bacilli and VRE were automatically identified by an electronic tag on admission, but preventive isolation based on risk factors was never performed.\n\nHand hygiene was primarily based on alcohol-based hand rubs.\n\nDecolonization with mupirocin was carried out only in patients with MRSA present exclusively in nares.\n\nChlorhexidine was used for oral hygiene, but not for body bathing.\n\nSelective decontamination of the digestive tract or any additional practice, such as the use of extraordinary prophylactic antibiotics (except as clinically recommended in neutropenic, cirrhotic or HIV patients), was not performed during the study.\n\nThere were no changes in isolation or hand hygiene practices during the study period.\n\nDefinitions Colonization was defined as the isolation of P.\n\naeruginosa from a surveillance culture or non-sterile clinical sample.\n\nPatients with P.\n\naeruginosa isolated within 48 hours of ICU admission were considered to be colonized upon admission.\n\nOrganisms isolated 48 hours after admission in patients with previous negative specimens were considered as ICU-acquired.\n\nInfection was considered the reason for admission when the organic failure leading to critical care was understood to be a direct consequence of either the dysfunction of the infected organ or sepsis.\n\nAcquisition of resistance was defined as the isolation of a resistant organism in a patient with a previous sensitive strain or prior negative cultures.\n\nEmergence of resistance to a given antibiotic refers to the conversion of a genotypically defined strain from susceptible to non-susceptible; hence, these isolates were also included in the previous definition.\n\nCross-transmission was considered to have occurred when a patient acquired a pulsotype identical to that of an isolate previously found in a patient who stayed in the unit during the same period.\n\nColonization pressure was estimated as the average of the daily proportion of colonized patients (number of patients colonized divided by number of patients in the unit on a given day) from the day of admission until the day before acquisition of the microorganism or until discharge if the patient did not acquire the microorganism [38].\n\nTime at risk was the number of days until the detection of the microorganism and/or resistance in patients who acquired it and the whole length of ICU stay if the patient did not acquire it.\n\nExposure to antibiotics meant at least 24 hours of treatment.\n\nStatistical analysis For continuous variables, means (with standard deviations) or medians (with interquartile ranges (IQRs)) were used as measures of central tendency (dispersion).\n\nDenominators in proportions were always \u2018number of patients\u2019.\n\nProportions were compared by using the \u03c72 test or Fisher\u2019s exact test, and continuous variables were compared by using the t-test or Mann\u2013Whitney U test.\n\nMultivariable logistic regression analysis (step-forward procedure) was used to evaluate characteristics associated with the acquisition of P.\n\naeruginosa and acquisition of resistance to ceftazidime, piperacillin-tazobactam, carbapenems and quinolones.\n\nFor the purpose of analysing the risk factors associated with the acquisition of P.\n\naeruginosa, patients colonized or infected with this microorganism upon admission were excluded, owing to uncertainty about the ability to detect their new episodes of acquisition.\n\nHowever, the whole cohort was considered when we analysed the risk factors for the acquisition of resistance to the different antipseudomonal antibiotics, because resistance could emerge in strains of P.\n\naeruginosa present upon admission.\n\nAge, APACHE II score and SOFA score were introduced into the models as dichotomous variables, taking the median as the cutoff value, whereas colonization pressure was dichotomized by the highest observed value (95th percentile).\n\nIn multivariate models predicting the acquisition of strains resistant to each antipseudomonal agent and multiple drugs, a cutoff of 72 hours was used to dichotomize antibiotic exposure because in previous studies it appeared to be the best time span for defining the minimal duration of exposure associated with resistance [39,40].\n\nVariables with a P-value <0.3 in the univariate analysis were introduced into the multivariate model.\n\nCalculations were done using the IBM SPSS version 20.0 statistical software package (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).\n\nResultsDuring the 35-month study period, a total of 850 patients were hospitalized in the unit for 72 hours or more.\n\nPatient characteristics and exposures are shown in Table 1, and a detailed description of the reasons for admission is provided in Additional file 1.In regard to antibiotic exposure, 751 patients (88.3%) received an antibiotic, 562 (66.1%) of which were antipseudomonal agents.\n\nThe median daily dosages of antipseudomonal antibiotics were 6 g for ceftazidime, 3 g for carbapenems (meropenem or imipenem; there was no exposure to ertapenem), 12 g for piperacillin-tazobactam, 1,200 mg for ciprofloxacin, 500 mg for levofloxacin and 1 g for amikacin.\n\nThe median days (IQR) of exposure to antipseudomonal antibiotics were 6 (3 to 11) for ceftazidime, 6 (3 to 10) for carbapenems, 5 (3 to 8) for piperacillin-tazobactam, 6 (3 to 10) for ciprofloxacin, 4 (3 to 8) for levofloxacin and 4 (2 to 10) for amikacin.\n\nThe median (IQR) length of ICU stay was 5 (4 to 10) days.During the study period, a total of 9,561 surveillance samples were obtained and cultured, of which 1,646 proceeded from the lower respiratory tract, 2,664 from the pharynx, 2,690 from the nares and 2,561 from the rectum.\n\nThe mean numbers per included patient was 3.2 for nasal swabs, 3.1 for pharyngeal swabs, 3 for rectal swabs and 1.9 for respiratory samples (3.3 in intubated patients).A total of 68 patients (8%) were colonized with P.\n\naeruginosa upon admission, and of the remaining 782, 104 (13.3%) acquired at least one strain of P.\n\naeruginosa during their ICU stay (4 patients acquired 2 different strains).\n\nAcquired isolates belonged to 79 distinct pulsotypes, of which 7 were obtained from more than 1 patient (from 2 to 20).\n\nThe more numerous cluster, which included 20 patients, corresponded to a strain that had a XDR phenotype on 16 occasions.\n\nOf the 104 patients who acquired P.\n\naeruginosa, in 20 (19.2%) acquisition was due to cross-transmission (13 of the XDR genotype) and in the remaining patients the origin was unknown.\n\nThe sites of primary detection were the rectum in 57 cases (54.8%), the nares or pharynx in 16 (15.3%), the lower respiratory tract in 10 (9.6%), more than one of these sites in 19 (18.2%) and other sites in 2 (1.9%).\n\nOf the 57 patients with initial unique rectal colonization, 18 (31.5%) had subsequent nasopharyngeal (n =3) or lower respiratory tract colonization (n =15).\n\nIn all, 48 patients (46.1%) eventually had P.\n\naeruginosa isolated from a lower respiratory sample (in 24 as a first site of colonization and in 24 as a secondary one), of whom 13 (27%) had pneumonia (11 ventilator-associated).\n\nDetection in tracheal aspirates or sputum preceded pneumonia in seven patients for a median of 3 days (range, 1 to 14), and it was coincidental with its clinical diagnosis in the remaining six patients.\n\nPneumonia occurred more frequently in patients with first detection of P.\n\naeruginosa in the lower respiratory (8 of 24 (33.3%)) than in other sites (5 of 80 (6.2%)) (P =0.002).\n\nOther infections diagnosed in the 104 patients who acquired P.\n\naeruginosa were ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis in 9, catheter-related bacteraemia in 3, primary bacteraemia in 2 and a surgical wound infection in 1.\n\nTracheobronchitis was equally common in patients with first detection of P.\n\naeruginosa in the lower respiratory tract (2 of 24 (8.3%)) than in other sites (7 of 80 (8.7%) (P =1), whereas the 6 other infections occurred in patients in whom P.\n\naeruginosa was first detected outside the lower respiratory tract.\n\nSites of primary and secondary acquisition are shown in detail in Additional file 2.\n\nRisk factors for acquisition of Pseudomonas aeruginosa The acquired strains were susceptible to all antipseudomonal antibiotics in 56 patients (53%), PDR in 1 (1%), XDR in 17 (16%), MDR in 4 (4%) and resistant to 1 or 2 groups of antipseudomonal antibiotics in 27 (26%).\n\nUpon acquisition, resistance to carbapenems, piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftazidime, fluoroquinolones and amikacin was observed in 39 (37%), 19 (18%), 30 (29%), 29 (28%) and 1 (1%) strains, respectively.\n\nThe univariate analysis of the relationship between patient\u2019s characteristics or exposures and the acquisition of P.\n\naeruginosa is shown in Table 2.\n\nMultivariate analysis selected shock, orotracheal intubation, enteral nutrition for \u22643 days, parenteral nutrition for \u22643 days, tracheostomy and colonization pressure >0.43 as being independently associated with the acquisition of P.\n\naeruginosa, whereas exposure to fluoroquinolones for >3 days was protective.\n\nThe complete model is shown in Table 3.Table 2 Relationship between Pseudomonas

analysis of the association of prior exposure to carbapenems, ceftazidime, piperacillin-tazobactam, fluoroquinolones and amikacin with acquisition of resistance to the different antipseudomonal antibiotics and multiple drugs is shown in Additional file 3.\n\nIn multivariate analysis, carbapenem exposure for more than 3 days was associated with acquisition of resistance to itself, and amikacin exposure for more than 3 days was associated with acquisition of resistance to piperacillin-tazobactam and fluoroquinolones as well as MDR.\n\nExposure to fluoroquinolones, piperacillin-tazobactam or ceftazidime was not associated with acquisition of resistance to themselves or to other antipseudomonal agents.\n\nComplete models are shown in Additional file 4.\n\nEmergence of resistance to a given antipseudomonal agent from a previous susceptible strain after exposure to itself occurred in 4 (20%) of 20 patients exposed to ceftazidime (vs 8 (8%) of 106 non-exposed; P =0.1), 6 (46%) of 13 exposed to carbapenems (vs 1 (3%) of 95 non-exposed; P <0.001), 3 (15%) of 20 exposed to piperacillin-tazobactam (vs 9 (8%) of 117 non-exposed; P =0.3) and 8 (29%) of 28 exposed to fluoroquinolones (vs 2 (3%) of 94 non-exposed; P <0.001).\n\nDiscussionThe main findings of this study are the following: (1) colonization pressure and several patient conditions or instrumentations seem to be more relevant risk factors than exposure to antibiotics for the acquisition of P.\n\naeruginosa; (2) exposure to fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin) for >3 days was protective against the acquisition of this pathogen; (3) exposure to carbapenems predicted resistance to themselves; and (4) amikacin exposure was associated with the acquisition of resistance to piperacillin-tazobactam, quinolones and multiple drugs.Whenever cross-transmission is involved in the acquisition of a given microorganism, it is expected that colonization pressure should be a relevant risk factor.\n\nAlthough defined in different ways, colonization pressure has been independently associated, in the ICU setting, with the acquisition of MRSA [41], VRE [38], Clostridium difficile [42], Acinetobacter baumannii [33,43] and P.\n\naeruginosa [16,33,44].\n\nHowever, in none of the MRSA studies, and in only some on A.\n\nbaumannii [43,45] or P.\n\naeruginosa [16], was adjustment for prior antibiotic exposure performed.\n\nSome reports indicate that there is an interaction between colonization pressure and antibiotics.\n\nIn one study in which investigators searched for predictors of P.\n\naeruginosa acquisition in the ICU [44], prior exposure to \u22653 days of non-antipseudomonal antibiotics was a significant risk factor only when there was at least one colonized patient in the unit.\n\nThis fact supports the notion that, in previously non-colonized patients, antibiotics cannot promote acquisition of resistance without relying on transmission.\n\nIn another study on imipenem-resistant A.\n\nbaumannii acquisition, antimicrobials were found to be a risk factor only for patients admitted during periods in which colonization pressure was low [45], suggesting that the role of antibiotics may be relatively more important when there are fewer opportunities for patient-to-patient transmission.\n\nOur data indicate that colonization pressure, measured as originally described [38], was an independent risk factor for the acquisition of P.\n\naeruginosa in a critical care setting where most patients were exposed to antibiotics (87% to any drug and 64.7% to an antipseudomonal antibiotic) and 19% of the acquisition episodes were due to cross-transmission.\n\nWe think that having a daily colonization pressure chart for the main pathogens of interest in a given ICU may therefore be useful for quantifying the risk of new acquisitions and establish the appropriate control measures aimed at preventing this untoward event.In regard to the role of antibiotics, the most striking finding of the present study was that fluoroquinolones were actually protective for the acquisition of P.\n\naeruginosa and rather neutral for the acquisition of its resistance phenotypes.\n\nIn critically ill patients, in the few previous studies in which researchers have specifically investigated P.\n\naeruginosa acquisition, findings have been that fluoroquinolones are protective against it in the pharynx [46] or in any site [28].\n\nIn hospital-wide studies, levofloxacin (but not ciprofloxacin) has been reported to be protective against nosocomial infection due to fluoroquinolone-susceptible P.\n\naeruginosa [12] and also against Gram-negative bacilli (including P.\n\naeruginosa) colonization or infection with chromosomally mediated cephalosporin resistance [47].\n\nAll these data, including ours, suggest that fluoroquinolones, when administered to critically ill patients not previously colonized by P.\n\naeruginosa, may decrease the burden of new acquisition, even in settings where the prevalence of resistance to fluoroquinolones is around 29%.\n\nEven more surprising is the persistent inability of our group to find an independent association between prior exposure to antipseudomonal quinolones and the acquisition of a particular resistant phenotype or MDR [28].\n\nA plethora of previous case\u2013control or cohort studies have linked this antibiotic class with resistance to themselves [11-13], to antipseudomonal \u03b2-lactams [10,17-19] or to multiple drugs [21,23,25-27].\n\nWe do not have a satisfactory explanation of this discrepancy, but the fact that we found such association (of prior use of quinolones with resistance to themselves and MDR) in the univariate analysis, but not in the multivariate analysis, enhances the absolute need of careful consideration of potential confounders.\n\nIn contrast to fluoroquinolones, the present data confirm the involvement of prior carbapenem use in acquisition of resistance to itself [9,14-16].\n\nIt is of note that, in our experience, both quinolones and carbapenems had a higher propensity than ceftazidime or piperacillin-tazobactam to select resistance to themselves when administered to patients previously colonized with susceptible strains.\n\nThese data suggest that, in critically ill patients not colonized by P.\n\naeruginosa or at low risk of carriage, quinolones may be safer than carbapenems in terms of risk of acquisition of resistant strains and may even lower the burden of P.\n\naeruginosa.\n\nIn other circumstances, ceftazidime and piperacillin-tazobactam can be associated with a lower risk of resistance acquisition because they apparently have a lesser tendency than carbapenems to select resistance in patients previously colonized.\n\nHowever, when trying to select an appropriate empirical antibiotic regimen in patients with severe sepsis, it remains appropriate to avoid the administration of a recently used antipseudomonal antibiotic, to take into consideration the local rates of P.\n\naeruginosa resistance if this pathogen is an issue and to consider the risk of other MDR microorganisms [48].In the present study, previous administration of amikacin was associated with the acquisition of resistance to fluoroquinolone, piperacillin-tazobactam and multiple drugs in the multivariate analysis.\n\nA small number of prior studies have also noted an association between amikacin or aminoglycosides and acquisition of P.\n\naeruginosa resistant to imipenem, [9,14] ceftazidime [9], piperacillin-tazobactam [8] and multiple drugs [13,24].\n\nWe consider that such an association cannot be attributed to the selection of MexXY overproducers [49], because no increase in amikacin minimum inhibitory concentrations were observed.\n\nAlthough relying on multivariate analysis, there is still room for non-casual associations; hence, these should be validated in other studies.Many of the non-antibiotic-related confounders in our study denoting exposure to medical devices, severity of the underlying condition and duration of critical status have previously been reported as risk factors for the acquisition of any P.\n\naeruginosa or strains with single-drug resistance or MDR phenotypes [3,28,50].This study has several limitations, the most obvious being that it was conducted in a single medical ICU whose results may not be applicable to other settings with different epidemiological characteristics.\n\nIn addition, the number of outcomes regarding the different resistance phenotypes and MDR were scarce, thus increasing uncertainty about the quality of the multivariate models.\n\nOn the other hand, as sensitivity of surveillance cultures was probably not complete, the colonization status of some patients could have been misclassified.\n\nFinally, information about compliance with infection control measures during the study period and surveillance cultures from the environment was not available.\n\nConclusionsIn ICU settings with a high rate of antibiotic use, colonization pressure and non-antibiotic exposures may be more important than antibiotics as determinants of P.\n\naeruginosa acquisition; antipseudomonal quinolones may actually prevent it; and, regarding the acquisition of resistance to selected \u03b2-lactams (piperacillin-tazobactam), fluoroquinolones and multiple drugs, exposure to amikacin may be a more crucial risk factor than previously recognized.\n\nKey messages In ICU settings with a high rate of antibiotic use, colonization pressure and non-antibiotic exposures are the main determinants of P.\n\naeruginosa acquisition.\n\nFluoroquinolones may prevent the acquisition of P.\n\naeruginosa.\n\nCarbapenem exposure is associated with acquisition of carbapenem resistance, and amikacin exposure is associated with acquisition of resistance to piperacillin-tazobactam and fluoroquinolones and MDR.\n\nIn previously sensitive strains of P.\n\naeruginosa, emergence of resistance occurs more frequently after exposure to carbapenems and fluoroquinolones than to ceftazidime or piperacillin-tazobactam.\n\nAbbreviations APACHE: Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation CI: Confidence interval CNS: Central nervous system COPD: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease CVC:

adherence to a 5 day antibiotic course guideline for treating intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) infections.\n\nMethods Descriptive analysis of patient-level data on all GNB-active antibiotics prescribed from day 3 and all GNB identified in clinical samples in 5350 patients admitted to a 30 bed general ICU between 2002 and 2009.\n\nResults Four thousand five hundred

between gentamicin and meropenem in the number of first courses in which a resistant GNB was identified in blood cultures [11/1177 (0.9%) versus 5/351 (1.4%); P = 0.43] or respiratory tract specimens [59/951 (6.2%) versus 17/246 (6.9%); P = 0.68] at the time of starting therapy.\n\nConclusions This study demonstrates long-term adherence to a 5 day course antibiotic guideline for treatment of ICU-associated GNB infections.\n\nThis guideline is a potential antibiotic-sparing alternative to currently recommended dual empirical courses extending to \u22657 days.\n\nKey words aminoglycosides antibiotic resistance Gram-negative bacteria Previous SectionNext Section Introduction There are concerns about increasing antimicrobial resistance, particularly amongst Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) in the intensive care unit (ICU).1,2 This has led to the introduction of stewardship programmes promoting guideline adherence to reduce unnecessary antimicrobial prescribing.3 Writing antibiotic guidelines for ICU infections is challenging because of the need to balance making recommendations that ensure appropriate empirical therapy for likely pathogens against restricting unnecessary antibiotic use that selects for resistance.4 Many studies show a benefit associated with early appropriate empirical therapy,5\u201310 although some do not.11\u201314 International guidelines for ICU-acquired infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, usually, but not always, favour two empirical antibiotics active against GNB to ensure appropriate therapy.15\u201317 The benefit of a dual empirical therapy approach is the focus of many studies but remains controversial.18\u201323 One approach to reducing unnecessary therapy when two empirical antibiotics are used is to de-escalate to a single active agent once susceptibility patterns are known;24,25 however, once two agents have been started de-escalation may be difficult for a variety of reasons, including uncertainty as to the causative organism.26 There is also limited evidence to guide recommendations on the length of therapy and the extent to which this should be influenced by the focus, degree of sepsis or causative organism.\n\nGuidelines for pneumonia and sepsis frequently recommend 7\u201310 days,15,25 whereas guidelines for catheter-related bloodstream infection point out there are no compelling data to support specific recommendations.27 Few studies have provided information on actual prescribing practice.28\u201331 Our ICU guideline has recommended a 5 day single antibiotic course for ICU-acquired GNB infections for many years.32 The objectives here were to determine adherence over an extended period of time and to assess the susceptibility of GNB identified at clinical sites to the prescribed antibiotics.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section Methods This work was conducted in the Centre for Clinical Infection and Diagnostic Research (CIDR) and the ICU at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust.\n\nStudy design and setting Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust is a 1150 bed, dual-site central London teaching hospital with a 30 bed mixed medical and surgical ICU on the St Thomas' Hospital site.\n\nPatient-level clinical, demographic, microbiological culture and antimicrobial prescribing data on patients admitted to the ICU between January 2002 and December 2009 were extracted from clinical information systems [Intellivue, clinical information portfolio (Philips), iSOFT and the in-house microbiology computer system] with local ethics committee approval (10/H1102/80) as recently published.33 Prior to any linking and analysis, data were processed, cleaned and corrected using patient names, ICU location and hospital number identifiers.\n\nFewer than 100 patients had identification inconsistencies or missing data.\n\nDefinitions and statistics The day of admission was defined as day 1.\n\nThe longest ICU stay for each patient extending at least until day 3 was analysed, with two episodes <2 days apart being collapsed into a single episode.\n\nOnly systemic antibiotic therapy commenced from day 3 was analysed.\n\nAntibiotic course length was defined as the number of continuous days of therapy on which at least one dose of antibiotic was received, apart from gentamicin and amikacin, for which a gap of 1 day between doses was called continuous therapy.\n\nComparisons between inappropriate therapies were made using the two-sided \u03c72 test for the null hypothesis of equality of proportions, with a modified Bonferroni procedure to adjust the level of significance for multiple testing.34 Two-sided P values are reported.\n\nAntimicrobial prescribing guidelines and practice An antibiotic guideline developed by intensivists, microbiologists and pharmacists was in place throughout the 8 years.\n\nThe guideline recommended gentamicin, administered with an extended-duration dosing protocol (5 mg/kg lean body weight; maximum 500 mg), as first-line empirical or targeted therapy for all GNB infections.\n\nCeftazidime was recommended as an alternative first-line agent in renal failure or at the intensivist's discretion.\n\nCiprofloxacin and piperacillin/tazobactam were recommended for suspected resistance or allergy to other first-line antibiotics.\n\nMeropenem or amikacin was reserved for subsequent episodes of sepsis (second-line) or suspected resistance.\n\nAll patients with severe sepsis or septic shock were recommended to receive a single dose of gentamicin if a non-aminoglycoside antibiotic course was selected.\n\nThese recommendations for ICU-acquired GNB infections remained in place throughout the 8 years.\n\nThe guideline recommended initial electronic prescription of a 5 day course regardless of suspected focus.\n\nAll antibiotic prescriptions were reviewed daily at the bedside by microbiologists, pharmacists and intensivists together.\n\nThe clinical response and microbiological culture results were used to decide on the need to deviate from the guideline.\n\nDe-escalation to a narrower-spectrum antibiotic was not generally undertaken when bacterial susceptibility results became available because of the short time to stop date.\n\nMicrobiological culture Microbiological culture results were analysed from all clinical site samples taken on the ICU.\n\nThroat and rectal screening swabs were also collected on admission and every Monday to identify gentamicin-resistant GNB.\n\nTen percent of patients had a positive gentamicin resistance screen on admission but results from these screening swabs are not included in the analysis.\n\nAll GNBs were identified and had antimicrobial susceptibilities determined using standard laboratory techniques.33 Before August 2008, susceptibility patterns were determined using agar disc diffusion according to BSAC standards.35 Thereafter the VITEK system (bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy-l\u2019\u00c9toile, France) was used.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section Results Five thousand three hundred and fifty patients admitted to the ICU between 2002 and 2009 had at least one ICU episode extending beyond the third day of admission and comprised the study cohort.\n\nThe median age was 65 (IQR 51.5\u201374.8) years and 62.6% were males.\n\nTheir median admission APACHE II score was 18 (IQR 14\u201322), the median ICU length of stay was 8 days (IQR 5\u201317) and ICU mortality was 25.5%.\n\nEighty-four percent (4511) of cohort patients received 6793 courses of any systemic antibiotic active against GNB (average 1.5 courses/patient), of which 5709 (84%) were with the six guideline-recommended antibiotics (Table 1).\n\nFurther analysis predominantly focused on these six antibiotics.\n\nView this table: In this window In a new window Table 1.\n\nAntimicrobials with activity against GNB prescribed for ICU-acquired infections and the frequency of resistance of GNB identified at clinical sites at the time of starting therapy Gentamicin and then ceftazidime were the most frequently prescribed antibiotics in terms of number of courses, days of therapy and number of treated patients, consistent with the guideline (Table 1).\n\nThirty-one percent of all cohort patients received gentamicin and 17% received ceftazidime, whereas <10% received each of the other antibiotics (Table 1).\n\nMedian time to starting a course of gentamicin and ceftazidime for ICU-acquired infections was less than that for ciprofloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam, meropenem or amikacin (5 and 6 versus 9\u201311 days) (Figure S1, available as Supplementary data at JAC Online).\n\nData on the longest course of each antibiotic administered to each patient are presented in Figure 1.\n\nThe mode of the longest course length for gentamicin and amikacin was 1 day, compared with 6 days for other anti-Gram-negative agents.\n\nOnly 6% (342/5709) of courses with the six guideline-directed antibiotics spanned >6 days.\n\nThe median length of continuous active antibiotic therapy commenced at the time of identifying a GNB in blood cultures was also 6 days (IQR 4\u20137; n = 383).\n\nOverall, 75.1% (3120/4151) of first courses of the six guideline-directed antibiotics ended whilst the patient remained alive and on the ICU.\n\nView larger version: In this window In a

prescription days with one or two antibiotics active against GNB is presented in Table S1 (available as Supplementary data at JAC Online).\n\nOf 21 248 days of therapy with GNB-active antibiotics commenced from day 3, 18 614 (88%) were with a single agent.\n\nSixty-one percent (1616/2634 days) of dual therapy days included gentamicin and 25% (1616/6298) of gentamicin therapy days were in combination with another agent.\n\nOf the 5350 patients, 3254 (61%) had a GNB cultured from one or more clinical site samples during their ICU stay (Table 2).\n\nThere was significant variation in the percentage of patients identified with a GNB resistant to the different antibiotics (range 9%\u201327%).\n\nPercentages were higher if the number of patients in whom a GNB was identified for microbiological analysis was used as the denominator (14%\u201344%) (Table 2).\n\nThe time to first detection of a GNB resistant to each antibiotic is shown in Figure 2.\n\nDays 1 and 2 were the most frequent days for first detection of resistance to all six antibiotics, indicating a significant burden of importation of resistant GNB at clinical sites.\n\nThe median time to first detection of resistance was longer for amikacin and meropenem (9 and 10 days, respectively) compared with other antibiotics (5\u20136 days).\n\nView this table: In this window In a new window Table

antibiotic courses for which a resistant GNB was identified at a clinical site at the time of starting antibiotic therapy (\u00b11 day of first dose) was used as a measure of inappropriate therapy (Table 1).\n\nFor positive blood cultures this ranged from 0.9% of gentamicin courses to 3.3% of ceftazidime and piperacillin/tazobactam courses, and for respiratory tract samples this ranged from 6.2% of gentamicin courses to16.5% for piperacillin/tazobactam courses.\n\nSome differences reached statistical significance (Table 3).\n\nView this table: In this window In a new window Table 3.\n\nPresence and resistance of GNB in blood and respiratory tract samples taken at the time of commencing the first course of each antibiotic Previous SectionNext Section Discussion This study demonstrated long-term adherence to a 5 day single-antibiotic course guideline for ICU-associated GNB infections.\n\nAn average of 1.5 courses of GNB-active antibiotics were prescribed per treated patient, with course length spanning \u22646 days of therapy in 94% of cases and 88% of therapy days being with a single GNB-active antibiotic.\n\nThis implies that the multidisciplinary team considered a 5 day course to be adequate for the majority of ICU-acquired GNB infections.\n\nThis likely includes those at the more severe end of the spectrum, given that a similar course length was also prescribed when local infections were associated with a bacteraemia.\n\nThere was infrequent practice of prescribing multi-day combination courses of anti-GNB therapy or immediate commencement of further courses with different antimicrobials at the end of 5 days, both of which would have led to a much higher proportion of dual-therapy days or courses per patient.\n\nAntibiotics started on days 1 and 2 were excluded because they are often started prior to arrival, for a different spectrum of bacteria causing infections that often require longer courses, such as endocarditis, osteomyelitis or meningitis.\n\nThis study focused on therapy for infections acquired on the ICU that are predominantly due to breach of an epithelial surface following insertion of a catheter, drain or knife, or bypassing of other surface defences following insertion of endotracheal or urinary catheters.\n\nThe rationale for recommending a 5 day course was that iatrogenic breach of epithelial surfaces can be considered as a homogeneous process, independent of site or bacterial species, even though the clinical response may differ significantly.\n\nThus, a single course length and antibiotic choice could be recommended, assuming that attention is given to early source control.\n\nCorona et al.30 highlighted the large variation in duration of therapy for ICU bloodstream infections from <7 to >14 days, indicating that the course length recommended here is at the lower end of that range.\n\nThere is some evidence that longer courses are required for ventilator-associated pneumonia due to environmental Gram-negative bacteria.36 The course length may have been extended for such infections, given that 6% of courses spanned >6 days, but this was not specifically assessed.\n\nAnother aspect of this guideline requiring comment is the recommendation of a single empirical antibiotic course.\n\nThere are probably three reasons why this recommendation had a high level of adherence despite significant unit-level resistance.\n\nFirstly, the guideline recommended an adjunctive single dose of gentamicin for patients with severe sepsis if other antibiotic classes were selected.\n\nSecondly, culture results from admission clinical samples and gentamicin-resistance screens would become available to guide therapy choices from the third day of admission.\n\nThis may help explain why the frequency of inappropriate therapy was similar for gentamicin and meropenem (Table 3) despite gentamicin having higher unit-level resistance (18% and 9% respectively; Table 2).\n\nFinally, the proportion of treatment courses resulting in inappropriate initial therapy based on the antibiogram was comparable to other studies.5\u201314,18\u201323 A dominant role for aminoglycosides in critically ill patients, even as short courses or single doses, may be controversial.\n\nAminoglycosides penetrate relatively poorly into tissues, require careful monitoring to reduce the risk of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity, and are difficult to dose in renal failure.37,38 However, they have advantages such as low rates of allergy and less disturbance of bowel flora and potentially Clostridium difficile infection compared with other antibiotics.39 Aminoglycosides have been prescribed as first-line treatment on our ICU for over 40 years32 and the policy remained in place in 2013, apart from changing ceftazidime to piperacillin/tazobactam as an alternative first-line antibiotic.\n\nThere are limitations to this study.\n\nIt was performed at a single centre and so resistance rates and guideline implementation will differ hugely between units and countries.30 We did not determine whether bacterial culture represented infection versus colonization, or determine the association between appropriateness of antibiotic choice and patient outcomes.\n\nSuch considerations are important and have been the focus of many observational studies with conflicting results.5\u201314 Finally, the laboratory had an expert rule advising all Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter, Serratia, Morganella and Providencia species to be reported as resistant to cephalosporins and piperacillin/tazobactam regardless of test result.\n\nThis rule was controversial and not implemented rigorously; nevertheless some resistant isolates will have been reported rather than measured as resistant, which would falsely increase resistance to ceftazidime and piperacillin/tazobactam.\n\nIn summary, balancing the potentially conflicting objectives of ensuring appropriate therapy for bacterial infections with preventing unnecessary antibiotic use is a challenge in patients with a new septic episode in the ICU.\n\nThis paper demonstrates high long-term multidisciplinary team adherence to a guideline for all ICU-acquired GNB infections that recommends a 5 day single antibiotic course combined with the option of a single initial aminoglycoside dose in patients with severe sepsis.\n\nFurther studies are needed to determine whether this antibiotic-sparing approach is an acceptable alternative to currently recommended longer dual-therapy course guidelines.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section Funding This work was supported by an educational grant from Pfizer as part of the AIRE Foundation programme.\n\nJ.\n\nD.\n\nE., C.\n\nA.\n\nM.\n\nand

{"content": "AbstractNearly 1.3 million total joint replacement procedures are performed in the United States annually, with numbers projected to rise exponentially in the coming decades.\n\nAlthough finite infection rates for these procedures remain consistently low, device-related infections represent a significant cause of implant failure, requiring secondary or revision procedures.\n\nRevision procedures manifest several-fold higher infection recurrence rates.\n\nImportantly, many revision surgeries, infected or not, require bone void fillers to support the host bone and provide a sufficient tissue bed for new hardware placement.\n\nAntibiotic-eluting bone void fillers (ABVF), providing both osteoconductive and antimicrobial properties, represent one approach for reducing rates of orthopedic device-related infections.\n\nUsing a solvent-free, molten-cast process, a polymer-controlled antibiotic-eluting calcium carbonate hydroxyapatite (HAP) ceramic composite BVF (ABVF) was fabricated, characterized, and evaluated in vivo using a bacterial challenge in a rabbit radial defect window model.\n\nABVF loaded with tobramycin eliminated the infectious burden in rabbits challenged with a clinically relevant strain of Staphylococcus aureus (inoculum as high as 107 CFU).\n\nHistological, microbiological, and radiographic methods were used to detail the effects of ABVF on microbial challenge to host bone after 8 weeks in vivo.\n\nIn contrast to the HAP/BVF controls, which provided no antibiotic protection and required euthanasia 3 weeks post-operatively, tobramycin-releasing ABVF animals showed no signs of infection (clinical, microbiological, or radiographic) when euthanized at the 8-week study endpoint.\n\nABVF sites did exhibit fibrous encapsulation around the implant at 8 weeks.\n\nLocal antibiotic release from ABVF to orthopedic sites requiring bone void fillers eliminated the periprosthetic bacterial challenge in this 8-week in vivo study, confirming previous in vitro results.\n\nCitation: Brooks BD, Sinclair KD, Grainger DW, Brooks AE (2015) A Resorbable Antibiotic-Eluting Polymer Composite Bone Void Filler for

$41.8 billion by 2016 based on an anticipated annual growth rate of 7.4% from 2009\u20132016 [1,2].\n\nThis growth can be attributed to increased applications in aging global populations and in new patient groups from developing countries [1,3].\n\nMajor contributors to this growth are revision Total Joint Replacements (TJRs), including Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) revisions projected to exceed 50,000 annually by 2030 and Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) revisions projected to number nearly 250,000 procedures by 2030 [4].\n\nDespite the success of TJRs in improving quality of life, up to 10% [5] of these implanted devices fail, requiring revision procedures [6] at a cost of $42,000-$56,000 per revision procedure (U.S.) [7].\n\nDespite consistently low failure rates (~1\u20133%) for primary TJR procedures, TJR infection persists as a significant cause of implant failure, recurrent failure, and skyrocketing treatment costs.\n\nInfection recurrence rates in revision surgeries are anticipated to increase drastically to 20\u201330% [8,9].\n\nRising numbers of TJRs combined with finite infection rates have yielded dramatic growth in numbers of patients worldwide suffering with these devastating infections [10\u201312].\n\nConsequently, infection prevention and treatment both continue to be ongoing foci of the orthopedic community.\n\nTo address this increasing healthcare threat, current therapeutic interventions for periprosthetic infections include: 1) systemic intravenous or oral antibiotic therapy, 2) surgical intervention (e.g., irrigation and debridement, resection arthroplasty, and/or revision arthroplasty), and 3) local antibiotic therapy (e.g., antibiotic loaded bone cement (ALBC) and ALBC spacers as both permanent and temporary implants).\n\nUnfortunately, each approach suffers limitations and clinical management of these complex infections often includes a mixture of therapies, techniques, and antibiotics.\n\nSystemic long-term antibiotic treatment often fails due to poor tissue site biodistribution as well as combinations of systemic side effects, poor patient compliance, and the development of drug-resistant pathogens [13\u201315].\n\nSurgical interventions place additional financial, temporal, occupational, or other life-style burdens on the patient and do not guarantee infection elimination.\n\nFinally, local antibiotic therapy (e.g., bone cement spacers and beads) has demonstrated the ability to reduce periprosthetic infection rates; however, this approach also possesses limitations.\n\nALBC (e.g., Palacos G from Biomet, DePuy 1 from DePuy Orthopaedics, Cemex Genta from Exatech, Versabond AB from Smith & Nephew, or Simplex P from Stryker Orthopaedics), the most common local antibiotic-delivering device for orthopedic applications, is regulated in the U.S. by the FDA for use in total joint arthroplasty revision surgeries, lacking adequate drug release kinetics to protect the entire device [16\u201322].\n\nMoreover, after an initial drug-releasing burst phase, antibiotic concentrations quickly decline and antibiotic leaches at sub-therapeutic levels for months to years [10,19].\n\nThis not only facilitates antibiotic resistance at the implant site, but also allows any unretrieved bone cement to act as a foreign body and nidus for recurrent infection [23,24].\n\nTherefore, new antimicrobial strategies that effectively reduce known complications associated with revision TJR procedures are a compelling need.\n\nWhile surgical TJR procedures, including THA and TKA, account for the majority of bone void filler (BVF) utilization, a large percentage of the more than two million orthopedic procedures performed annually in the U.S. use BVFs for repair of traumatic injury or other boney defects [25\u201328].\n\nSignificantly, a substantial fraction of secondary non-cemented revision TJR procedures require bone graft to support host tissue implant integration.\n\nConsequently, the demand for BVFs is estimated at ~$1.3 billion within an expanding $29 billion total orthopedics biomaterial market [25,29,30].\n\nEstimates put the BVF market for knee reconstruction alone at $600 million by 2030 with an additional $150 million for THA (estimated from an average BVF volume per revision of 12.7 ml and ~$1,800 per surgery); the future need for BVF with reliable osseointegration and antimicrobial properties is therefore substantial [3,31].\n\nA successful BVF will be biologically active, possessing the following characteristics: biocompatibility (tissue-benign with minimal foreign body response), bioresorbability, and osseointegrating (integration with host bone) [5,13,26].\n\nGiven the high incidence of infections in TJR revisions and the prevalence of bone graft in these procedures, a resorbable antibiotic-eluting BVF is considered an attractive clinical option [5,28].\n\nThe hypothesis driving this work is that an implanted resorbable antibiotic-eluting BVF with extended drug release capability reliably prevents bone infection while facilitating bone integration and eventual resorption.\n\nPrevious reports [13, 32] utilizing this polymer-controlled, antibiotic-releasing BVF demonstrated the ability to eliminate high bacterial inocula (e.g., 107 colony forming units (CFU) per milliliter) in in vitro assays [13] beyond 8 weeks.\n\nThus, based on extensive in vitro characterization, a BVF composite comprising synthetic highly porous inorganic granules combined with other clinically familiar degradable components (e.g., both inorganic and polymer phases) [33\u201337] should provide appropriate pharmacokinetics to eliminate a periprosthetic bacterial challenge and provide a resorbable, osteoconductive scaffold to facilitate host tissue integration in a rabbit radial window defect model.\n\nThe hypothesis was investigated using the following aims: 1) assess in vivo antimicrobial efficacy and 2) determine the suitability of the antibiotic-eluting BVF to provide an osteoconductive matrix to support active bone remodeling using an established rabbit radial window defect model [23, 27].\n\nThese aims were evaluated using quantitative and qualitative assessments of histology, radiography, and microbiology.\n\nHere we report the first phase of an extensive in vivo study designed to follow on previous in vitro testing [13,25,32] Methods Antibiotic-Eluting BVF Fabrication Antibiotic-eluting BVF devices were fabricated as previously described [32].\n\nBriefly, granular ceramic commercial bone grafting biomaterial (ProOsteon 500R \u2014a hydroxyapatite (HAP) calcium carbonate-based hybrid coralline bone void filler, Biomet, USA\u2014HAP/BVF hybrid) was morselized and sieved to 150\u2013425 \u03bcm.\n\nPolycaprolactone (~24% w/w, 10 kDa, PCL, Sigma 440752) and polyethylene glycol (~3% w/w, 20 kDa, Sigma P2263) were mixed and melted at 75\u00b0C.\n\nSubsequently, morselized ProOsteon 500R hydroxyapatite coralline (HAP) granules (~63% w/w) and tobramycin sulfate powder (~10% w/w, Research Products International) were mixed into the molten two-component polymer slurry.\n\nTable 1 summarizes this implant compositional design for each implant cohort.\n\nThe molten bone void filler mixture was compressed into a single silicone mold containing twelve 2 mm x 2 mm x 6 mm rectangular cutouts.\n\nThe resulting rectangular BVF implants were allowed to solidify at room temperature and then quality control-assessed as described previously [32].\n\nAll BVF implants were sterilized via Sterrad sterilization, a low temperature hydrogen peroxide gas plasma processing to preserve both polymer integrity and antibiotic activity prior to implantation.\n\nDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Table 1.\n\nCohort designs for rabbit radial window defects implanted with bone graft with or without tobramycin and with or without S.\n\naureus.\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0118696.t001 Cohort Experimental Design Each cohort included seven animals according to a power analysis and as supported by literature [34,38].\n\nFor Cohorts 1, 2 and 5, the ProOsteon 500R HAP/BVF hybrid was not granulated and instead was shaved to be the same dimensions (~2 mm x 2 mm x 6 mm) as the antibiotic-eluting BVF polymer composite devices.\n\nCohort 1 did not include any antibiotic, polymer, or infectious inoculum to assess the sterility of the surgical procedure.\n\nAnalogous with the Cohort 1 implant, Cohort 2 did not include any antibiotic or polymer but did include an infectious inoculum to assess the ability of the experimental model to produce a propagating bone infection in the presence of the BVF/HAP device substrate.\n\nCohort 2 was designed to represent the current clinical standard for filling bone voids.\n\nTo serve as a direct challenge to Cohort 2 the antibiotic- eluting bone void filler (Cohort 7) was developed to reduce the rate of device related infection, associated with these procedures, as well as act as a bone void filling material.\n\nNo antibiotic was utilized in Cohorts 3 and 4 to assess the safety of the polymer components of the device both in the absence (Cohort 3) and the presence (Cohort 4) of an infectious inoculum.\n\nCohort 5 implants, representative of a current clinical practice comparator, were not a granulated HAP/BVF hybrid but instead a larger \u201cshaved\u201d fragment of HAP/BVF soaked in a 10% tobramycin saline solution for 10 minutes immediately prior to implantation.\n\nCohort 6 was implanted with the polymer-controlled, antibiotic-eluting BVF/HAP composite device but did not include an infectious inoculum.\n\nThis cohort was also extended to 24-weeks to allow sufficient time for cellular infiltration and host bone ingrowth (i.e. osseointegration).\n\nCohort 7 (test cohort) was designed to assess the antimicrobial efficacy of the polymer-controlled, antibiotic-eluting BVF/HAP composite device by including a rigorous infectious challenge.\n\nThis test cohort was subsequently compared to Cohort 2 (isolated the BVF/HAP hybrid component of the device), Cohort 4 (isolated the BVF/HAP hybrid substrate with the polymer components), and Cohort 5 (representative of current clinical practice\u2014release of drug from BVF/HAP hybrid in the absence of the polymer barrier).\n\nBacterial Strain All bacterial inocula and in vitro microbial methods used Staphylococcus aureus (S.\n\naureus) strain UAMS-1 (ATCC strain 49230) as previously described [13,34,32,39].\n\nFor preparation of bacterial inoculum, the strain was grown overnight on 5% sheep blood agar at 37\u00b0C.\n\nIsolated colonies were suspended in sterile saline to an optical density of 105 (Cohorts 2, 4, and 5) or 107 (Cohort 7) CFU in 50 \u03bcL using a nephelometer (BD Biosciences, USA).\n\nNote that Cohort 7 (test device) was inoculated with 100-fold larger CFU to provide a more rigorous infectious challenge.\n\nIn Vivo Rabbit Radial Infection Model All experiments were carried out in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Utah (Center for Comparative Medicine, an AAALAC-approved facility, University of Utah) under the direction of skilled veterinary staff.\n\nSeven cohorts (n = 7) (Table 1) of skeletally mature New Zealand white rabbits (3\u20134 kg) were used to isolate each variable of the new drug delivery system to assess the antimicrobial efficacy of the device (see Cohort Experimental Design and Table 1).\n\nRabbits were individually housed in temperature-controlled cages at 30\u201340% humidity under a 12-hour light/dark cycle and provided food and water ad libitum.\n\nThe surgical procedure was adapted from prior protocols of Koort et al.\n\n[38] and Smeltzer et al.\n\n[39].\n\nBriefly, each rabbit was weighed, body temperature was recorded, and the rabbits were anesthetized with isofluorane for the duration of the surgery.\n\nThe medial surface of the right forelimb was clipped and scrubbed with a povidone iodine surgical scrub solution (Medline, USA) followed by three wipes with 70% ethanol and a final povidone iodine surgical scrub solution to create a sterile field.\n\nSubsequently, the surgical site was draped and the medial surface of the radius was surgically exposed.\n\nA transcortical defect (~6 mm by 2 mm by 2 mm) was drilled using a burr with saline irrigation into the proximal medial metaphysis of the right radius (Fig.\n\n1).\n\nThe local bone marrow was removed by saline lavage and 105 (Cohorts 2, 4, and 5, Table 1) or 107 (Cohort 7, Table 1) CFU of S.\n\naureus was injected into the medullary canal, proximal to the window defect.\n\nNo bacteria were used in control cohorts (Cohorts 1, 3 and 6, Table 1).\n\nThe surgical defect was then filled with the antibiotic-eluting BVF (each device was approximately 42 mg).\n\nThe sterilized 2 mm x 2 mm x 6 mm antibiotic-eluting BVF device was press-fit into the drilled bone window defect and the soft tissue was closed over the defect with 3.0 silk sutures.\n\nWhen placed, the BVF device appeared to have only minimal penetration into the marrow space and was clearly visible in the surgical site prior to soft tissue closure.\n\nA fur patch at the nape of the neck was clipped and a fentanyl patch applied for post-operative pain control.\n\nAdditionally, buprenorphine was administered subcutaneously (0.03 mg/kg) for immediate analgesic effects.\n\nThe dosage was repeated at 8\u201310 hour intervals 2\u20133 times as indicated for pain management or prescribed by veterinary staff.\n\nPerioperative antibiotics, usually the standard of care, were withheld due to study objectives.\n\nRabbits were monitored daily for signs of pain or distress and examined weekly under isofluorane anesthesia throughout post-operative recovery.\n\nWeekly examinations included radiographs, temperature and weight recordings, wound site evaluation and scoring, and blood microbiology for systemic infection determination.\n\nRabbits exhibiting symptoms of infection including altered body temperature, suppressed appetite, purulent discharge from the wound site, radiographic evidence of progressive osteomyelitis, and/or altered gait were removed from the study prior to the study endpoint.\n\nDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Fig 1.\n\nSchematic describing

scale for bone health (Table 2) and a modification of the Petty grading scale for infection (Table 3) as well as recommendations of veterinary staff [40\u201342].\n\nAnimals were euthanized if a composite score of greater than 2.5 was observed, using NIH guidelines for the humane treatment of animals as well as approved in University of Utah IACUC protocol 12\u201301004.\n\nAnimals were euthanized in cases of blood-borne infection, overwhelming localized infection, excessive signs of distress, appetite suppression, limited water consumption, lethargy, or lameness.\n\nBriefly, animals were anesthetized with isofluorane prior to injection of beuthanasia (1 ml / 4.5 kg).\n\nDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Table 2.\n\nModified Checketts\u2019

Radiography Pre- and post-operative radiographs were captured as well as weekly images from both anteroposterior and lateral views using an OEC Miniview 6600 (GE Healthcare).\n\nInfection indicators were assessed on the basis of evidence: (a) inflammation, (b) bone necrosis, (c) widening of the bone shaft, (d) formation of new bone, and (e) deformation of soft tissue [39].\n\nPost-Operative Microbiology Following euthanasia and dissection of the surgical site, aseptic swabs of the soft tissue and of the implant site in the bone were taken.\n\nSwabs were cultured on 5% sheep blood agar plates for 24 hours to 72 hours at 37\u00b0C.\n\nBone Histological Processing Post-euthanasia, each implant site was dissected for fixation.\n\nImportantly, soft tissue was dissected from the bone and processed independently.\n\nBone samples were cut no thicker than 3\u20135 mm to ensure fixative penetration.\n\nAll steps of the fixation and dehydration process occurred at room temperature at 20 times the volume of the sample [41].\n\nBoth bone and soft tissue samples were placed in 10% Neutral Buffered Formalin (NBF) (Fisher, USA) for 3 days.\n\nThe fixative was changed and replaced twice for another 3 days.\n\nThe samples were then placed in 70% ethanol (EtOH) for 2\u20133 days.\n\nThe samples were rinsed for 10 minutes in deionized (DI) water.\n\nThe 70% EtOH step was repeated three times for 24 hours each.\n\nThe samples were then placed in 95% EtOH three times for 24 hours each.\n\nThe sample was then placed in 100% EtOH three times for 24 hours.\n\nAfter fixation, bone samples were infiltrated by methyl methacrylate (MMA) under vacuum at 4\u00b0C.\n\nThe fixed bone samples were placed into a 200 ml container of 80% methyl methacrylate (MMA, Polysciences, USA) and 20% n-butyl phthalate (plasticizer, Sigma Aldrich, USA) for five days.\n\nNext, bone samples were infiltrated sequentially by placing the sample into a 200 ml container of: 1) 80% MMA and 20% n-butyl phthalate and 0.1 grams of benzoin methyl ether (Polysciences, USA) for seven days and 2) 80% MMA and 20% n-Butyl phthalate and 0.2 grams of benzoin methyl ether for 9 days.\n\nAfter infiltration, bone samples were placed in an ultraviolet (UV) light-transparent container and embedded to a 2\u20133 cm depth of a solution of 80% MMA and 20% n-butyl phthalate and 0.2 grams of benzoin methyl ether and allowed to polymerize under UV exposure.\n\nThe embedding step was repeated until the sample was completely encased in hard poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) with each PMMA layer being allowed to cure prior to the next layer being added.\n\nSamples were cut into 1 mm thick sections using a bone saw (Isomet Low Speed Buehler Saw) and mounted on plastic histology slides after which they were ground and polished to optical transparency (~50\u201370 \u03bcm).\n\nHistological Staining Each section was ground (400 grit sand paper) and polished (0.3 \u03bcm aluminum silicate polisher) to visual clarity.\n\nThree sections from each sample were stained using a Sanderson\u2019s rapid bone stain (Dorn and Hart Microedge, USA) with an acid fuchsin counter stain according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol.\n\nBriefly, Sanderson Rapid Bone Stain (SRBS) and a water wash were heated to 55\u00b0C.\n\nSRBS was applied to sections for 2 minutes after which the slide was rinsed in water wash (20 seconds).\n\nSlides were not dried and the acid fuchsin was applied for 15\u201330 seconds followed by room temperature water wash for 20 seconds.\n\nSlides were visualized using either a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U with a 12-bit Retiga Exi color camera (QImaging, USA) and QCapture software or the Zeiss Axio scan.Z1 with Zen software to stitch the images together.\n\nImages were captured at a 2x-20x magnification.\n\nHistological Scoring Histology was scored (scale of 0 to 4) by three independent and blinded investigators under light microscopy for: 1) capsule thickness (4 = <50 \u03bcm; 0 = >250 \u03bcm), 2) inflammatory response (4 = no inflammatory response; 0 = moderate to severe inflammation with abscess), 3) cellular infiltration (4 = mostly bone; 0 = dense tissue and exclusively inflammatory cells), and 4) qualitative bone reaction (4 = similar appearance to host bone; 0 = dead bone) according to Sinclair\u2019s histomorphological scale [40].\n\nAll scores from a single cohort were averaged for each metric.\n\nStatistical Methods Based on pilot studies, seven rabbits per cohort were necessary for statistical significance (an expected difference of 2.0 in the ratio for the antimicrobial cohort versus the control cohort with no antibiotics, a standard deviation for both cohorts of 1.0, a type I error of 0.05, and power of 80% [43]).\n\nPairwise one-way ANOVA was used to determine significant differences between cohorts (p \u2264 0.05) based on the semi-quantitative scoring of Sanderson stained histology slides.\n\nResultsTo corroborate previous in vitro findings of extended antimicrobial efficacy [13,32], antibiotic-eluting BVF polymer composite implants were manufactured as described previously [32] and implanted into a cortical window defect in an established rabbit radial model (Fig.\n\n1) [38,39].\n\nAntibiotic-eluting polymer-controlled BVF/HAP composite devices were easily fabricated in controlled dimensions, readily handled and compressed into the molds, shaped and carved for facile perioperative manipulation in diverse bone site dimensions and geometries.\n\nEach component of the BVF polymer composite was isolated and investigated to assess the specific in vivo response to the BVF (Cohorts 1 and 2), the polymer component (Cohorts 3 and 4), the surgical procedure (Cohort 1), normal host bone healing (Cohort 1), and the antibiotic-eluting BVF polymer composite (Cohorts 6 and 7).\n\nAnimals were divided into seven statistically significant cohorts and evaluated for morbidity and mortality, to assess both safety and antimicrobial efficacy.\n\nCohorts are described in the materials and methods above and in Table 1.\n\nMorbidity and Mortality Scoring Morbidity and mortality were monitored for eight weeks (Fig.\n\n2).\n\nMorbidity was scored according to the modified Checketts\u2019 and Petty scales shown in Tables 2 and 3 [40].\n\nImportantly, the higher the score the more adverse the outcome or the more morbidity was noted.\n\nAnimals in infected control (Cohort 2) displayed significant distress with distinct signs of morbidity and infection (average score two weeks post-operative was 2.36 \u00b1 0.85).\n\nAll Cohort 2 animals had to be euthanized between 2\u20134 weeks per animal care guidelines.\n\nAnimals in all remaining cohorts (Cohorts 1, 3\u20137) survived throughout the study as indicated by 100% survival (Fig.\n\n2B).\n\nImportantly, animals in control uninfected (Cohort 1) implanted with a carved monolith of commercial HAP only displayed minimal symptoms of background surgical morbidity (average score two weeks post-operative was 0.17 \u00b1 0.41).\n\nAnimals implanted with antibiotic-eluting BVF polymer composite and inoculated with 107 CFU S.\n\naureus (compared to 105 S.\n\naureus used for the other cohorts) showed little to no morbidity (average score two weeks post-operative was 0.17 \u00b1 0.38).\n\nAntibiotic controlled release (Cohort 7) was compared to intra-operatively HAP/BVF granules soaked in tobramycin (Cohort 5\u2014average score two weeks post-operative was 1.08 \u00b1 0.49) and placed in the defect site.\n\nCohort 5 showed more morbidity than Cohort 7 polymer-controlled antibiotic release as indicated by the higher score (Fig.\n\n2).\n\nSurprisingly, Cohort 4 (BVF with polymer but lacking antibiotic) showed signs of morbidity (average score two weeks post-operatively was 1.00 \u00b1 0.00) but little to no mortality.\n\nAnimal temperature and weight never varied beyond the standard deviation for all the study animals (data not shown), and only animals in Cohort 2 produced a positive mid-study culture (data not shown).\n\nDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Fig 2.\n\nA) Rabbit morbidity

Microbiology To verify that signs of infection and morbidity were attributed to a localized and not a systemic infection, blood was collected weekly and cultured for the presence of bacteria.\n\nAll Cohort 2 animals were euthanized prior to the 8-week study endpoint (between 2 and 4 weeks) due to substantial localized infection.\n\nAt necropsy, swabs of soft tissue and bone surrounding the surgical site were aseptically obtained and cultured (Fig.\n\n3).\n\nNot surprisingly, every Cohort 2 animal showed significant bacterial counts from bone swabs, and the majority (85.7%) of animals were colony-positive from soft tissue swabs, although colonies were not counted.\n\nAll colonies appeared to be homogenous S.\n\naureus colonies.\n\nNo colonies were detected in either the bone or soft tissue from Cohort 1 or Cohort 3 animals.\n\nOnly a few animals in control Cohorts 4 and 5 were colony-positive from bone swabs (28.6% and 14.3% respectively) with additional positive cultures from soft tissue swabs (71.4% and 28.6% respectively).\n\nNone of the animals included in antibiotic-eluting BVF Cohort 7 were colony-positive in either bone or the soft tissue, despite the substantially larger infectious S.\n\naureus inoculum.\n\nDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Fig 3.\n\nMicrobiology assessments post euthanasia.Data represent

Radiographic Evaluation Bone response to the antibiotic-eluting BVF was assessed via weekly radiographic evaluations.\n\nAll animals in Cohort 2 showed radiographic signs of infection and/or displacement of the implant as it was ejected from the surgical site into adjacent soft tissue (Fig.\n\n4).\n\nAlternatively, animals in Cohort 1 showed no such radiographic evidence of device displacement, no evidence of significant soft tissue inflammation, and a slightly protruding boney callus formation.\n\nAnimals in Cohort 7 also showed no device displacement, no overt signs of soft tissue inflammation, and only minimal signs of boney callus formation (Fig.\n\n4).\n\nThere was also radiolucency surrounding the Cohort 7 device that may be an additional indication of inadequate host bone ingrowth.\n\nUnfortunately, radiograph resolution was insufficient for complete analysis of bone-implant response.\n\nDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Fig 4.\n\nRadiological analysis and callus formation (Cohorts 1, 2, and 7).Only infectious Cohorts 2 and 7 are shown for comparison while Cohort 1 is included as a non-infection comparator.\n\nThe presence of a distinct boney callus in Cohorts 1 and an incomplete bridging callus in Cohort 7 are indicative of bone healing.\n\nAlthough soft tissue inflammation cannot be quantitatively assessed, there appeared to be little or no soft tissue inflammation in Cohort 7 compared to Cohort 1, indicating a relatively normal bone healing response.\n\nCohort 2 shows pronounced signs of infection as the device is displaced (indicated by a red arrow).\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0118696.g004 Histologic Evaluation Visual analysis of the dissected surgical site showed bridging callus formation in Cohort 1 and incomplete bridging in Cohorts 4 and 7, typical of normal bone healing (data not shown).\n\nSanderson\u2019s-stained histology sections (Fig.\n\n5) corroborated the findings of the radiographic images, showing significant soft tissue inflammation and device displacement in Cohort 2 and more complete bone bridging with little soft tissue response in Cohort 7.\n\nBased on a published scoring system (Tables 2 and 3) [40, 42], Cohort 2 had 1) minimal capsule thickness (0.14 mm \u00b1 0.36 mm), 2) significant osteoclastic resorption (1.07 \u00b1 0.96), 3) minimal to mild inflammation with abscess (0.67 \u00b1 1.18), and 4) dense inflammatory tissue surrounding the implant (0.47 \u00b1 0.64) in the absence of the device polymer components (Fig.\n\n6).\n\nComparatively, Cohorts 4 and 7, which both had implants with a polymer matrix component, produced significantly different assessments when compared to Cohort 2, but not significantly different to each other when considering the quality of the bone (1.78 \u00b1 0.88 and 2.38 \u00b1 1.09 respectively, p = 0.052) or the capsule thickness (2.11 \u00b1 1.32, 2.75 \u00b1 1.06, respectively.\n\np = 0.067), which was \u2265100 \u03bcm and \u2264150 \u03bcm.\n\nCohort 4 did not produce significantly more inflammation compared to Cohort 7 (p = 0.02), but did produce less than Cohort 2 (p < 0.005) (2.44 \u00b1 1.04 and 3.19 \u00b1 0.66, respectively).\n\nCohort 7 did have significantly different (p = 0.013) osseointegration (2.69 \u00b1 0.048) compared to Cohort 4 (1.94 \u00b1 1.06), but greater integration when compared to Cohort 2 (p < 0.005).\n\nNeither Cohort 4 nor 7 had substantial osseointegration evident at 8 weeks (Fig.\n\n6).\n\nCohort 3 showed no statistically significant differences (capsule thickness p = 0.45, qualitative bone response p = 0.92, periprosthetic inflammation p = 0.78, bone ingrowth p = 0.29) when compared to Cohort 4 on any metric measured and thus the majority of the Cohort 3 data are not presented for purposes of clarity and will be presented in a future manuscript.\n\nCohort 6 animals were followed for 24 weeks to allow ample time for osseointegration; however, these results will be reported in a future manuscript, as this was the only cohort specifically designed to assess longer-term host bone integration.\n\nAll data presented is deposited in a public

DiscussionThe numerous BVFs currently used in bone repair remain susceptible to implant infection despite ongoing efforts to develop BVFs that locally release antibiotic [25, 35\u201337,44,45].\n\nLocal, extended antibiotic release to target pathogens at the BVF and prosthetic implant site minimizes development of antibiotic resistance by maintaining sustained drug amounts sufficient to eliminate microbial infection.\n\nUnfortunately, current designs that integrate local antibiotic release into BVF as a combination device suffer from large, early bolus drug release which not only risks local tissue toxicity in its magnitude, but exhibits bioactivity shorter than the clinically relevant 6\u20138 week window required to address senescent persistor organisms.\n\nReliable infection control throughout the critical 6\u20138 week post-operative window routine for TJR hardware exchange as standard of care for two-stage revision procedures [25] is critical.\n\nThese burst pharmacokinetics also leave patients susceptible to biofilm formation or development of antibiotic-resistant pathogens [10,25].\n\nThus, this work sought to develop an antibiotic-eluting BVF that 1) released antibiotic at therapeutic levels for 6\u20138 weeks, 2) was resorbable and osteoconductive, and 3) was able to integrate with host tissue.\n\nWe hypothesized that local antibiotic release would target pathogens at the BVF site and would eliminate the periprosthetic bacterial burden, as well as provide an osteoconductive matrix for bone remodeling.\n\nFor this to occur it was important that polymer resorption occur at a rate analogous to, or slightly faster than, the rate of host bone ingrowth.\n\nBased upon the observed and measured outcomes, this work corroborated previous in vitro work and demonstrated that the polymer-controlled, antibiotic-eluting BVF was able to eliminate a periprosthetic infection challenge of 107 CFU S.\n\naureus in vivo.\n\nAlthough animals implanted with the antibiotic-eluting bone void filler showed no signs of infection through 8 weeks, the device design failed to prove osteoconductive and integrated only minimally in 8 weeks with the surrounding host tissue as evidenced by histology.\n\nAnimals in control Cohort 1 showed no signs of infection, as expected, and validated the aseptic technique used for the surgical procedures.\n\nIn contrast, all animals in Cohort 2 demonstrated signs of a positive and progressive infection and required euthanasia within the first 4 weeks following the procedure due to unresolved, localized, serious infection (composite score greater than 2.5\u2014Fig.\n\n2B).\n\nAdditionally, Cohort 2 had the thickest fibrous capsule, most significant inflammation, lack of new bone growth, as well as significant bone abscess and dead bone (Fig.\n\n6).\n\nMost significantly, when compared to Cohort 2, the rabbits that received the polymer-controlled, antibiotic-eluting BVF (Cohort 7) remained healthy throughout the 8-week study, as predicted based on the previous in vitro kinetic results [13,32], having significantly thinner fibrous capsule (p < 0.005), less inflammation (p < 0.005), and more bone ingrowth (p < 0.005) despite a significantly more adverse bone reaction (p < 0.005).\n\nIn contrast, rabbits in the other deliberately infected cohorts (Cohorts 4 and 5) consistently exhibited clinical signs of infection, and/or showed culturable bacterial colonization of implants.\n\nIt was expected that Cohort 5 animals would show delayed onset infection, due to the lack of a polymer barrier and fast tobramycin diffusion away from the device.\n\nHowever, this was not observed (Fig.\n\n2A).\n\nBased on the improved morbidity over time, it is thought that the initial burst of antibiotic was sufficient to support the rabbit\u2019s substantial immune system [39,46] at an infectious burden of 105 CFU.\n\nSuch an effect is not anticipated with larger CFU inoculums.\n\nAnimals in infected Cohort 4, lacking antibiotic, displayed initial signs of infection (average Petty score of 1, two weeks post-operatively, Fig.\n\n2A) that eventually resolved.\n\nThis may suggest some intrinsic antimicrobial properties for the BVF HAP/PCL/PEG matrix (Fig.\n\n2).\n\nBased on previous in vitro studies that characterized the fabrication methodology [32], this device appeared to have a similar porosity and mechanical integrity as those implants that included antibiotic.\n\nAn antimicrobial effect in this cohort was unexpected, and the polymer\u2019s potential intrinsic antimicrobial properties are currently being explored.\n\nAll implants were placed immediately following pathogen inoculation in the marrow space.\n\nIntra-cohort evaluation of the consistency of the data suggested that time of incubation prior to device placement was not a significant contributor to inter-cohort differences.\n\nWhile in vivo kinetics and biodistribution of released drug were not determined, based on previous in vitro drug release kinetics [13,32] and literature reports [34] for this infection model, certain expectations were defined for each cohort; however, objectivity was retained via blinded scoring.\n\nAlthough this study allowed for significant discoveries pertaining to the bactericidal nature of this antibiotic-eluting BVF, this study is not without its limitations.\n\nMost significantly, osseointegration was not achieved in the course of the 8-week study in Cohorts 4 or 7, as evidenced by a comparison with the bone response of the antibiotic-soaked BVF/HAP in Cohort 5, which displayed a thinner fibrous capsule, minimal inflammation, and more tissue ingrowth (Fig.\n\n6).\n\nAfter eight weeks in vivo, Cohorts 4 and 7 revealed a thick fibrous capsule and minimal-to-no bone ingrowth (Figs.\n\n5 and 6A).\n\nNo significant difference in capsule thickness (p = 0.067) or qualitative bone response (p = 0.052) was detected between Cohorts 4 and 7 (Fig.\n\n6).\n\nYeo et al.\n\nexplored a PCL/tricalcium phosphate composite device implanted in the abdominal cavity of a rat over 24 weeks and noted the absence of foreign body giant cells, the hallmark of a chronic and pathological foreign body response, and a limited fibrous capsule.\n\nThe apparent discrepancy between the limited fibrous encapsulation observed in this prior study [47] and the pronounced encapsulation observed in the current study could be a reflection of vast differences in the in vivo model, the PCL molecular weight, or the methodologies used for device fabrication.\n\nNevertheless, an important feature of any implanted, degradable, polymer-controlled drug-releasing implant is the balance between implant degradation that enables appropriate drug pharmacokinetics to eliminate infection and host bone healing essential to the BVF [48,49].\n\nHealing and bone regeneration must occur at rates analogous to device degradation to preserve bone structural integrity [50\u201352].\n\nWe posit that the slow PCL degradation in vivo [53,54] in this BVF form inhibits bone cell infiltration and subsequent host bone integration (Fig.\n\n6D), and elicits the pronounced fibrous capsule formation in Cohorts 4 and 7.\n\nBased on the preponderance of relatively inactive yellow marrow in the intermedullary canal of the older, larger animals used out of necessity in this study [55], it is possible that the 8-week time point represented an inadequate time frame in which to see normal bone turn-over and osseointegration.\n\nHutmacher et al.\n\nconsidered bone mineralization and ingrowth into PCL scaffolds in both long-term (2 years) and short-term (15 weeks) in vivo model systems as an indication of biocompatibility, finding limited bone ingrowth within 15 weeks [56,57].\n\nAdditionally, Miyai et al.\n\nobserved limited new bone formation at the surface of their antibiotic releasing PCL/\u03b2-tricalcium phosphate device after 4 weeks in a rabbit mandible osteomyelitis model with significant ingrowth after 50 weeks [58]; however, they observed limited infection control.\n\nBoth of these studies produced similar results at their early time points when compared to the new bone growth observed in this study.\n\nNevertheless, polymeric/HAP composite components in future device formulations can readily be altered to accelerate the matrix resorption, facilitating improved host bone integration.\n\nFurthermore, the observed high burst rate and fractional load of antibiotic is known to hinder the ability of osteoblasts to initiate bone remodeling [59].\n\nPreliminary in vivo cytotoxicity experiments (not shown) do not support significant toxicity to cultured osteoblasts from this BVF drug release.\n\nTherefore, the actual in vivo host tissue response to these release kinetics and to this antibiotic are critical to the bone regenerative potential of this composite BVF device beyond its antimicrobial efficacy.\n\nConclusionWhile all of the BVF device components described (i.e., HAP/calcium carbonate granules, PCL and PCL polymer blends, antibiotic) have an extensive history of preclinical and clinical use [60], comparisons with other in vivo models exploring their use is of limited comparative value in the context of this new antibiotic BVF device.\n\nThe BVF combination device described here represents a second-generation antibiotic-releasing bone void filler [13\u201315,32,60] with improved molded fabrication (i.e., consistency, ease, etc.) and enhanced drug delivery and antimicrobial activity (e.g., for tobramycin, a release duration greater than 10-weeks in vitro).\n\nIn agreement with previous in vitro studies demonstrating extended bactericidal activity [13,32], in vivo implantation of the antibiotic-eluting BVF was able to eradicate the infection challenge throughout the 8-week post surgery experimental time course, meeting our first objective even in the presence of a rigorous, persistent local S.\n\naureus infectious challenge.\n\nFurthermore, in spite of inadequate osseointegration, the BVF platform described remains versatile enough to adapt to the constraints of the in vivo environment and can accommodate different antibiotics and drugs for release, even in combinations [32,61,62].\n\nFuture work will focus on improved osseointegration while maintaining the demonstrated anti-infective efficacy.\n\nAcknowledgments We gratefully acknowledge Biomet for generously providing their HAP/coralline product, ProOsteon

infections.\u2022Delay between delivery of drug types can render the treatment successful.\u2022Fitness cost associated with antibiotic-resistance shapes the optimal treatment.AbstractBacterial resistance to antibiotic treatment is a huge concern: introduction of any new antibiotic is shortly followed by the emergence of resistant bacterial isolates in the clinic.\n\nThis issue is compounded by a severe lack of new antibiotics reaching the market.\n\nThe significant rise in clinical resistance to antibiotics is especially problematic in nosocomial infections, where already vulnerable patients may fail to respond to treatment, causing even greater health concern.\n\nA recent focus has been on the development of anti-virulence drugs as a second line of defence in the treatment of antibiotic-resistant infections.\n\nThis treatment, which weakens bacteria by reducing their virulence rather than killing them, should allow infections to be cleared through the body\u05f3s natural defence mechanisms.\n\nIn this way there should be little to no selective pressure exerted on the organism and, as such, a predominantly resistant population should be less likely to emerge.\n\nHowever, before the likelihood of resistance to these novel drugs emerging can be predicted, we must first establish whether such drugs can actually be effective.\n\nMany believe that anti-virulence drugs would not be powerful enough to clear existing infections, restricting their potential application to prophylaxis.\n\nWe have developed a mathematical model that provides a theoretical framework to reveal the circumstances under which anti-virulence drugs may or may not be successful.\n\nWe demonstrate that by harnessing and combining the advantages of antibiotics with those provided by anti-virulence drugs, given infection-specific parameters, it is possible to identify treatment strategies that would efficiently clear bacterial infections, while preventing the emergence of antibiotic-resistant subpopulations.\n\nOur findings strongly support the continuation of research into anti-virulence drugs and demonstrate that their applicability may reach beyond infection prevention.KeywordsAntibiotic resistance; Anti-virulence drugs; Mathematical Modellingprs.rt(\"abs_end\");1.\n\nIntroductionBacterial resistance to antibiotic agents is an increasing problem in modern society.\n\nThe introduction of every new class of antibiotic (from the original \u03b2-lactam, penicillin, to the more recent lipopeptides such as daptomycin) has been followed by the emergence of new strains of bacteria resistant to that class, many emerging in the clinic only a few years after the introduction of the drug ( Butler and Buss, 2006, Clatworthy et al., 2007 and Lewis, 2013).\n\nGiven that the pace of antibiotic discovery has dramatically slowed down (most classes of antibiotic were discovered in the 1940s to the 1960s, the \u2018Golden Era\u2019 of antibiotics, with the past 40 years giving us only five significant new classes ( Butler and Buss, 2006 and Lewis, 2013) and pharmaceutical companies devoting less research into discovering new antibiotics ( Projan and Shlaes, 2004 and Mellbye and Schuster, 2011), this poses a huge problem.\n\nDevelopment of novel treatments for bacterial infections is of utmost importance.Traditional antibiotics are classed either as bactericidal or bacteriostatic, working to kill bacteria or inhibit bacterial growth respectively (Clatworthy et al., 2007 and Mellbye and Schuster, 2011).\n\nWhile effective in eliminating susceptible bacterial infections, antimicrobials impose selective pressure on the bacteria, leading to the rise of resistant clones within the bacterial population.\n\nResistance can be acquired either through spontaneous chromosomal mutation and then selection by antibiotic use, known as vertical evolution, or through acquiring genetic material from other resistant organisms, known as horizontal evolution (Tenover, 2006).\n\nHorizontal evolution occurs via mechanisms such as conjugation, transformation and transduction (Alanis, 2005) and can take place between strains of the same or different bacterial species.\n\nHorizontal evolution can lead to multidrug resistance and is a major concern in hospitals where resistant bacteria are able to remain viable despite antibiotic use and are the cause of many serious nosocomial infections in already vulnerable patients (Alanis, 2005 and Tenover, 2006).It has been suggested that the focus of new drug development should be on targeting virulence, the bacteria\u05f3s ability to cause disease (Clatworthy et al., 2007), but this approach remains controversial both in terms of its potential efficacy and its ability to counter microbial resistance.\n\nAnti-virulence drugs would minimise any harm caused by bacteria while they remain in the host until they can be cleared by natural defences.\n\nThis can occur either by being flushed out of the system or by being eradicated by the host\u05f3s immune response.\n\nThis should exert little to no selective pressure on the bacteria but this has not yet been proved in vivo.\n\nAnti-virulence drugs could target a range of mechanisms, including bacterial adhesion to host cells, toxin delivery or virulence gene regulation, all necessary for successful infection ( Clatworthy et al., 2007 and Mellbye and Schuster, 2011) and many of these are under investigation.\n\nIn the vast majority of cases these approaches have proved to attenuate but not clear infection and often only when used in infection-prevention (as opposed to post-infection treatment), see for example Hentzer et al.\n\n(2003), Rasmussen et al.\n\n(2005), Wright et al.\n\n(2005), Jakobsen et al.\n\n(2012), Curtis et al.\n\n(2014), Hraiech et al.\n\n(2014), Sully et al.\n\n(2014) (quorum sensing and signalling inhibitors), Felise et al.\n\n(2008) (secretion inhibitor), Krachler et al.\n\n(2012) (adhesion inhibitor), Liu et al.\n\n(2008) (direct modulator of the bacteria\u05f3s ability to suppress an immune response) and Hung et al.\n\n(2005) (colonisation inhibitor).We adopt a modelling approach to investigate the viability of anti-virulence drugs in silico.\n\nOur results suggest that, in combination with antibiotics and under specific treatment strategies, anti-virulence drugs can be effective in clearing bacterial infections where antibiotic resistance is a concern.\n\nOptimal treatment strategies are likely to be specific to the patient, infection and bacterial strain and (rather than attempt to pin-point exact strategies) we use this theoretical framework as a \u201cproof of concept\u201d, exploiting parameter surveys to investigate a range of scenarios, highlighting the potential and the need for targeting infections with tailored treatments in the future.\n\nGiven that every patient, infection and strain of bacteria are different, it is impossible to obtain a conclusive set of parameters which will suit all situations.\n\nWe therefore exploit parameter surveys to ascertain under what conditions certain behaviour will occur.This work lays the foundations for more detailed models incorporating mechanisms of specific types of anti-virulence drugs.\n\nThis will facilitate testing of the likelihood that microbial resistance to these novel drugs could emerge.\n\nWe address this briefly in Section 4 but leave this largely to further work due to the vast array of targets and resistance mechanisms that can be associated with anti-virulence drugs.\n\nUnless explicitly stated otherwise therefore, the description \u2018resistant\u2019 refers only to antibiotic-resistance in this work.2.

Model formulationThere are two main approaches usually taken when modelling the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria: within-host models, or within-hospital compartmental models.\n\nModels of hospital resistance usually follow a similar form to the classic \u201cSusceptible\u2013Infectious\u2013Resistant\u201d (SIR) models of epidemiology, looking specifically at how nosocomial infections will spread throughout the hospital, for example Austin and Anderson (1999), Lipsitch et al.\n\n(2000), and Webb et al.\n\n(2005).\n\nWhile such models are useful to develop strategies to prevent the spread of resistance, our focus is on treatment strategies to eliminate the emergence of an antibiotic-resistant subpopulation that has either arisen through random mutation and clonal expansion or through cross-contamination within a particular infection and under a specific treatment regimen.\n\nIf the resistant bacteria within a single host can be eliminated then the spread of resistance throughout the hospital is a less pressing concern.Existing mathematical models that focus on the within-host emergence of antibiotic-resistance examine how treatment strategies can both cause and be adapted to prevent the emergence of antibiotic resistance, for example Lipsitch and Levin (1997) and D\u05f3Agata et al.\n\n(2008).\n\nSuch models often neglect the effect of the host immune response, assuming it to be negligible or constant under the effect of the antibiotic.\n\nSince the efficacy of anti-virulence drugs will depend at least in part on the host\u05f3s innate immunity, we include cell-mediated innate immune response in the model.prs.rt(\"abs_1st_end\");", "golden": 0, "journal": "elsevier", "id": "PMID: 25701634"}

If not adequately treated, they may result in serious complications such as epididymitis in men and pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy in women (6).\n\nC.\n\ntrachomatis infection can be treated by several classes of antibiotics; macrolides (i.e., azithromycin) and tetracyclines (i.e., doxycycline) are the recommended options.\n\nAlternatively, fluoroquinolones and quinolones (i.e., ofloxacin) can be prescribed (7, 8, 9).\n\nN.\n\ngonorrhoeae can be treated with ceftriaxone or with ciprofloxacin when ceftriaxone is contraindicated and strains show no ciprofloxacin resistance (7, 8, 9).\n\nTreatment of N.\n\ngonorrhoeae is complicated by increasing rates of resistance to quinolones, tetracyclines, and penicillins and decreasing susceptibility to cephalosporins (3\u20135).\n\nAustralian research has postulated that C.\n\ntrachomatis may be incidentally treated in countries with a relatively high background antibiotic consumption (10, 11), as the overall annual number of antibiotic prescriptions generally outweighs the frequency of C.\n\ntrachomatis testing.\n\nThe volume of outpatient systemic antibiotic use increased in most European countries between 1997 and 2003, while consumption remained stable between 2007 and 2011 at a median consumption of 19.5 defined daily doses (DDD) per 1,000 inhabitants per day (12, 13).\n\nAn ecological analysis of studies from 12 European countries demonstrated an inverse correlation between tetracycline and macrolide use in the year 2002 and genital C.\n\ntrachomatis prevalence in all countries except the Netherlands (12).\n\nTetracyclines and macrolides belong to the most commonly prescribed group of systemic antibacterial antibiotics after penicillins (13).\n\nThe Netherlands has historically had the lowest prescription rate of all European countries, although an increase has been noted (reaching 11.4 DDD per 1,000 inhabitants per day in 2011) (13).\n\nThe C.\n\ntrachomatis test rate in the Netherlands has been estimated to be 3 per 1,000 persons in the community (14).\n\nWhile background antibiotic use may impact the transmission of STIs on a population level, it may also impact clinical practices since it affects the outcome of an STI diagnostic test and may interact with subsequent treatment.\n\nStudies among men and young women receiving antenatal, general practitioner, or sexual health care in Australia demonstrated that recent antibiotic use was associated with a lower prevalence and incidence of genital C.\n\ntrachomatis (1, 15, 16, 17).\n\nHowever, the specific antibiotic agents were not studied.\n\nSuch reports are lacking for N.\n\ngonorrhoeae, yet a similar phenomenon may be observed.\n\nThe consumption of antibiotics may lead to increasing rates of resistance in the population, so overall antibiotic use may impact the clinical practice of STI testing.\n\nThe number of incidentally treated N.\n\ngonorrhoeae infections is probably minimal, as N.\n\ngonorrhoeae is more symptomatic and is therefore more likely to be identified and treated promptly.\n\nIn this study, conducted in a country with low per capita antibiotic consumption (i.e., the Netherlands), we assessed the proportion of systemic antibiotic use before C.\n\ntrachomatis and N.\n\ngonorrhoeae genital and extragenital (anorectal and oropharyngeal) screening in women and men visiting an STI clinic.\n\nFurther, we tested the association between overall systemic antibiotic use and the specific agent and the result of subsequent C.\n\ntrachomatis and N.\n\ngonorrhoeae tests.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section MATERIALS AND METHODS Procedures and study population.The outpatient STI clinic of the South Limburg Public Health Service offers free-of-charge examination and treatment for STIs. The clinic has four fixed testing sites in South Limburg (population, 630,000).\n\nThe study population includes surveillance data from all patients 18 years and older who visited our STI clinic between August 2010 and October 2013 (n = 14,945).\n\nAt every new consultation, patients were tested urogenitally for C.\n\ntrachomatis and N.\n\ngonorrhoeae on first-void urine (men) or self-swab (women), and some of the patients (38%; n = 5,691) were also tested anorectally by self-swab (men and women) and/or oropharyngeally by nurse-taken swab (men and women).\n\nTesting was done by commercially available nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) (strand displacement amplification [SDA] [ProbeTec ET system; Becton Dickinson, MD, USA] or PCR [Cobas Amplicor or Cobas 4800; Roche, CA, USA); positive N.\n\ngonorrhoeae tests were confirmed by an in-house PCR.\n\nIn accordance with national guidelines, patients who tested positive were asked to return for treatment with azithromycin or doxycycline (in the case of C.\n\ntrachomatis) or with ceftriaxone (in the case of N.\n\ngonorrhoeae).\n\nFrom August 2010, we systematically registered (by self-report) whether patients had used antibiotics in the month preceding the screening test.\n\nAn additional open question was asked about the type of regimen used; patients filled in their prescribed course and/or their indication for use.\n\nVariables and statistical analyses.We assessed the prevalence of systemic antibiotic use and its association with C.\n\ntrachomatis or N.\n\ngonorrhoeae diagnoses.\n\nTo reduce confounding by indication (thereby excluding people who were recently treated for an STI), we removed certain consultations from the data: those that occurred within 45 days after a previous STI clinic consultation (n = 100) or consultations in which a client reported a C.\n\ntrachomatis or N.\n\ngonorrhoeae diagnosis in the past month (n = 70).\n\nThis resulted in 14,775 consultations in our analyses.\n\nOf all the people who answered \u201cyes\u201d for antibiotic use (n = 1,994), 132 reported using medication other than systemic antibacterial treatment (e.g., painkillers, nonsystemic [e.g., topical] antibiotics, antifungals, inhalation medication, or antihistamines), and an additional 61 reported no systemic antibiotic agent but an indication that was not likely for systemic antibiotic use (i.e., fungal infection, herpes, eye infection, parasitic worms, hay fever, or impetigo).\n\nIn our analyses, we considered the patients in these 193 consultations not to have used systemic antibiotics.\n\nOf the 1,801 remaining consultations in which antibiotic use was reported, named agents were given in 541 and no agents were named in the remaining 1,260.\n\nWe constructed several variables on antibiotic use (yes/no) by agent based on the reported antibiotic agent that was recommended for use against C.\n\ntrachomatis or N.\n\ngonorrhoeae: doxycycline, azithromycin, ofloxacin, erythromycin, amoxicillin, ceftriaxone, and ciprofloxacin.\n\nOther variables were constructed on the combined classes of reported agents: tetracyclines, macrolides, fluoroquinolones and quinolones, penicillins, cephalosporins, nitrofurantoin/fosfomycin/trimethoprim, and other (mainly metronidazole).\n\nFirst, we used chi-square analyses to compare characteristics of the study population, including antibiotic use, between women, heterosexual men, and men who have sex with men (MSM).\n\nSecond, we used chi-square tests to make associations between overall antibiotic use and age, gender, sexual orientation, and HIV positivity in the total group of 14,775 consultations.\n\nThird, we used univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses, accounting for repeated measures, to assess overall antibiotic use and antibiotic use by agent, gender, sexual orientation, HIV status, and age (and their interaction) as determinants for C.\n\ntrachomatis and for N.\n\ngonorrhoeae positivity.\n\nIn analyses evaluating antibiotic use by specific agent, we excluded consultations in which antibiotics were reported but no specific agent was named (n = 1,260, resulting in n = 13,515 used in analyses).\n\nOverall presence of C.\n\ntrachomatis and N.\n\ngonorrhoeae (at any site) was used as the outcome, but we also performed analyses stratified by anatomic site.\n\nWe noted differences between anatomic sites and considered a P value of <0.05 to be statistically significant.\n\nAnalyses were performed using the SPSS package version 20 (IBM Inc., Somers, New York, USA).\n\nEthical approval.The medical ethical committee of Maastricht University approved the study (no.\n\n11-4-108).\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section RESULTS Antibiotic use before STI testing.During 14,775 STI clinic testing consultations, 12.2% (n = 1,801) (95% confidence interval [CI], 11.7% to 12.7%) of clinic patients reported recent antibiotic use.\n\nWomen had higher rates of antibiotic use than heterosexual men or MSM, and antibiotic use increased with age (all P < 0.001) (Fig.\n\n1).\n\nAntibiotic use was also higher for those who were HIV positive (18.6%, versus 12.1% for HIV-negative patients) (P = 0.004).\n\nAntibiotics were used for various reasons (e.g., for urinary tract infections [UTI] and respiratory tract infections [RTI]), yet in the majority of cases (63%), data about antibiotic usage were absent.\n\nView larger version: In this window In a new window Download as PowerPoint Slide FIG 1 Proportion of antibiotic use in the past month by patients who visited an STI clinic for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae screening, divided by sexual orientation and age, for a total of 14,775 STI clinic consultations.\n\nThe specific agent(s) was named in 541 (30.0%) of the consultations where patients reported antibiotic use.\n\nThe reported frequencies of use are displayed in Table 1 and the shares of use in Fig.\n\n2.\n\nOf the named agents, 26.2% (n = 142) consisted of any of the following: doxycycline, azithromycin, ofloxacin, or erythromycin.\n\nAnother 6.3% (n = 34) consisted of ceftriaxone or ciprofloxacin.\n\nIn 46 consultations, patients reported using a combination of two different agents.\n\nThe antibiotics used varied by gender and sexual orientation (Table 1).\n\nPenicillins were most frequently reported, followed by nitrofurantoin/trimethoprim/fosfomycin (commonly used for UTI) in women and tetracyclines and macrolides in both men and women (Fig.\n\n2).\n\nView this table: In this window In a new window TABLE 1

screening, reported by sexual orientation.\n\nThere were 587 named agents in 541 STI clinic consultations.\n\nPrevalence of C.\n\ntrachomatis and association with antibiotic use.The overall prevalence of C.\n\ntrachomatis was 10.8% (95% CI, 10.3% to 11.3%) (Table 1), and recent antibiotic use was reported by 10.8% (173/1,597) of patients who received C.\n\ntrachomatis diagnoses.\n\nThe association between antibiotic use and C.\n\ntrachomatis differed between women, heterosexual men, and MSM (overall P interaction term, 0.019).\n\nIn univariate analyses, any recent antibiotic use was associated with a lower C.\n\ntrachomatis prevalence in heterosexual men and in MSM but not in women (Table 2).\n\nWhen adjusting for age and HIV status, the risk estimate for heterosexual men attenuated somewhat and became non-statistically significant; however, the risk remained for MSM (Table 2).\n\nAfter stratifying analyses of MSM by anatomic site, it appeared that the inverse association between antibiotic use and C.\n\ntrachomatis was observed only for anorectal C.\n\ntrachomatis in MSM (odds ratio [OR] adjusted for HIV and age, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.19 to 0.94) and not for genital C.\n\ntrachomatis in MSM (adjusted OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.27 to 1.23) or oral C.\n\ntrachomatis in MSM (adjusted OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.24 to 4.98).\n\nView this table: In this window In a new window TABLE 2 Proportions of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae positive screening diagnoses and association with preceding use of antibiotics from a total of 14,775 STI clinic consultations We also evaluated associations with specific agents, thereby excluding from our analyses the consultations with patients who reported antibiotic use but failed to name the agent used (Table 3).\n\nAdditional analyses demonstrated that whether or not a specific antibiotic agent was reported was not associated with C.\n\ntrachomatis (or with N.\n\ngonorrhoeae), nor was the reason for antibiotic use (UTI, RTI, or other) (data not shown).\n\nAs no interactions were observed between the evaluated agents and sexual orientation (all P > 0.20), this paper presents overall models assessing C.\n\ntrachomatis and N.\n\ngonorrhoeae (rather than separate models for women, heterosexual men, and MSM).\n\nIn both univariate and multivariate analyses, tetracycline use was inversely associated with C.\n\ntrachomatis (Table 3).\n\nFurther analyses showed the associations between tetracycline use and specific anatomic sites: for genital C.\n\ntrachomatis (OR adjusted for gender, sexual orientation, age, and HIV status, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.06 to 1.03) and for anorectal C.\n\ntrachomatis (adjusted OR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.04 to 1.88).\n\nOropharyngeal C.\n\ntrachomatis was not evaluated due to small numbers.\n\nView this table: In this window In a new window TABLE 3 Proportions of C.\n\ntrachomatis and N.\n\ngonorrhoeae positive screening diagnoses and association with preceding use of specific agents of antibiotics from a total of 13,515 STI clinic consultations Prevalence of N.\n\ngonorrhoeae and association with antibiotic use.The overall prevalence of N.\n\ngonorrhoeae was 1.9% (95% CI, 1.7% to 2.1%) (Table 1), and recent antibiotic use was reported by 13.1% (37/282) of patients who received N.\n\ngonorrhoeae diagnoses.\n\nOverall antibiotic use was not associated with N.\n\ngonorrhoeae, even when assessing associations for genital, anorectal, or oral N.\n\ngonorrhoeae (data not shown) or by sexual orientation (Table 2).\n\nIn univariate analyses, quinolone use was positively associated with N.\n\ngonorrhoeae, while the risk estimate attenuated somewhat and became non-statistically significant in multivariate analyses (Table 3).\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section DISCUSSION This is the first study to systematically assess the recent consumption of different antibiotic agents before STI testing and the impact of background antibiotic use on a C.\n\ntrachomatis and N.\n\ngonorrhoeae diagnostic test result in a clinical setting.\n\nOne out of eight clinic patients reported recent antibiotic use, of which only a minority were first-line treatments for C.\n\ntrachomatis or N.\n\ngonorrhoeae.\n\nTetracyclines were the only agents found to be associated with a lower C.\n\ntrachomatis prevalence.\n\nIn MSM, overall antibiotic use was associated with a lower anorectal C.\n\ntrachomatis prevalence.\n\nPrior antibiotic use was not associated with N.\n\ngonorrhoeae.\n\nThe observed recent antibiotic consumption rate (12%) may be higher than expected (5.5%, based on the background antibiotic consumption in the Netherlands of 11.4 DDD per 1,000 persons per day, considering a typical course of 5 days with a daily dose in each course that equals the DDD, depending on distribution of courses among individuals) (11, 13).\n\nIt is possible that the symptoms that led some patients to visit the STI clinic may have also prompted earlier health care visits (e.g., to their general practitioners).\n\nIt also has been not uncommon in some communities globally to use antibiotics for prophylactic reasons prior to screening tests (18).\n\nThe shares of the classes named were in line with reported rates from surveillance networks, with penicillins being most commonly used (13).\n\nTetracyclines (comprised mostly of doxycycline) were associated with a lower C.\n\ntrachomatis prevalence, confirming the ecological correlation found in other European countries between tetracyclines and a lower C.\n\ntrachomatis prevalence (11).\n\nWhile the consumption of macrolides per capita also correlated significantly with a lower chlamydia prevalence in Europe, the absence of an association between macrolides (azithromycin in particular) and C.\n\ntrachomatis prevalence in our current study was notable.\n\nAzithromycin is commonly applied by using 500 mg daily for 3 to 5 days in non-C.\n\ntrachomatis infections (e.g., in RTI); in C.\n\ntrachomatis infections, the recommended dosage is higher but the duration is shorter (one 1,000-mg dose).\n\nThis difference in regimens may explain the absence of an association between background azithromycin use and C.\n\ntrachomatis.\n\nStill, differences in regimen were also present for doxycycline and other macrolides (e.g., the recommended dose for non-C.\n\ntrachomatis sinusitis is lower than but of equal duration to that for C.\n\ntrachomatis infections).\n\nAlthough azithromycin is the most commonly used treatment for C.\n\ntrachomatis in many countries, its efficacy is currently under heavy debate, and several studies have demonstrated substantial posttreatment C.\n\ntrachomatis detection (19, 20).\n\nWhile C.\n\ntrachomatis DNA may remain detectable in up to 40% of patients after 3 weeks of treatment with azithromycin, it is unknown whether detection indicates a \u201cpersisting\u201d C.\n\ntrachomatis infection and whether detection rates differ between azithromycin and doxycycline (19, 20).\n\nThere are no comparison data from other studies, as no agent-specific associations at an individual level have yet been reported (15\u201317).\n\nWe could not confirm earlier Australian observations of an inverse association between overall antibiotic use and C.\n\ntrachomatis prevalence, except for MSM.\n\nThis may be due to differences in the study populations; the people in the current study are higher-risk STI clinic attendees who potentially are more prone to acquiring a new STI after recent antibiotic use but before screening, attenuating associations in STI clinic populations.\n\nHowever, STI clinics tend to not test individuals with recent STI exposure (patients are asked to come back after a certain window phase), and therefore, such a possible effect is likely to be minimal.\n\nA more likely explanation is that lower shares of consumption of anti-C.\n\ntrachomatis classes in the Netherlands than in Australia may explain the discrepancy.\n\nMSM in our study reported higher shares of tetracycline use than did heterosexual men or women; the latter group reported relatively high rates of use of nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim, or fosfomycin (i.e., agents not considered effective against C.\n\ntrachomatis).\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first report on the association between recent antibiotic use and N.\n\ngonorrhoeae.\n\nWe observed no association between recent antibiotic use and N.\n\ngonorrhoeae.\n\nThe implications for antibiotic use are broad and range from the contribution to antibiotic resistance, the utility of screening, and their impact on transmission and the epidemiology of infection.\n\nThe impact of our results on clinical practice should be considered in the light of superfluous testing (of incidentally treated cases) or unwanted effects of subsequent treatments (i.e., treatment interactions or induction of treatment-resistant N.\n\ngonorrhoeae isolates).\n\nFor N.\n\ngonorrhoeae, superfluous testing is likely not a problem, as ceftriaxone (first-line N.\n\ngonorrhoeae treatment) is infrequently used, and hence its impact on incidentally treated N.\n\ngonorrhoeae cases is probably limited.\n\nFor C.\n\ntrachomatis, one may argue that patients who had been treated recently (e.g., with azithromycin or doxycycline) should not be screened again for C.\n\ntrachomatis, as they could be assumed to have been cured (treated) or to have acquired their infection very recently (after antibiotic use).\n\nIn both cases they would not be eligible for screening.\n\nHowever, macrolide (or azithromycin) use was not associated with a lower C.\n\ntrachomatis prevalence, and in those patients who had used tetracyclines, the C.\n\ntrachomatis prevalence was low (3%) but not completely zero.\n\nAs noted before, it is yet unknown whether detected C.\n\ntrachomatis DNA really indicates a \u201cpersistent\u201d infection in treated cases, since no laboratory tests that can test this exist.\n\nAntimicrobial resistance and overuse of antimicrobials are considered serious threats, especially to the treatment of N.\n\ngonorrhoeae (5).\n\nIn 2011, the European Gonococcal Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme (Euro-GASP) found that 7.6% of isolates were resistant to cefotaxime (2.3% in the Netherlands) (RIVM, GRAS, 2013).\n\nEuro-GASP also detected isolates with decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone for the first time (21, 22).\n\nPenicillin-, tetracycline-, quinolone-, and fluoroquinolone-resistant N.\n\ngonorrhoeae isolates are now disseminated globally.\n\nOf all the patients with diagnosed N.\n\ngonorrhoeae in our study, 13% reported recent antibiotic use.\n\nPotential induced resistance to first-line N.\n\ngonorrhoeae treatment (ceftriaxone) does not (yet) seem to be an important factor in current clinical treatment of N.\n\ngonorrhoeae.\n\nHowever, N.\n\ngonorrhoeae seems to retain resistance to several classes of antimicrobials, even when the antimicrobials in question are discontinued.\n\nHence, resistance to other antimicrobials may still be a point of concern.\n\nThe prevalence of N.\n\ngonorrhoeae and C.\n\ntrachomatis in patients who used quinolones was higher than in those who did not use quinolones.\n\nThis finding should be interpreted with caution due to relatively low numbers.\n\nNevertheless, it may reflect the possibility that symptoms related to C.\n\ntrachomatis and N.\n\ngonorrhoeae have caused patients to use quinolones before visiting the STI clinic for further testing.\n\nOn the other hand, it could be hypothesized that the marginally positive association may reflect possible increased susceptibility due to its effect on protective alternative microbiota (23).\n\nFinally, the possible interaction (antagonistic or synergic) effects between treatments should always be carefully considered in clinical practice for persons who are currently using antibiotics.\n\nAltogether, the impact of background antibiotic use on STI clinic practice seems relatively limited so far, although this may change with increasing antibiotic consumption and may be different in countries with a higher background antibiotic consumption.\n\nThis study has several limitations.\n\nFirst, the information on antibiotic use was based on self-reporting, which is subject to both under- and overreporting biases.\n\nSecond, the specific antibiotic agent could not be identified in two-thirds of consultations.\n\nThe reported indications were not attributed to a specific agent, as the first-line regimens and their use in practice did not refer to a single agent or class of antibiotics.\n\nThis limited our analyses to some extent, especially by largely underestimating the prevalence of use of specific agents in the total population and possibly attenuating observed associations with STI prevalence.\n\nWe have no reason to assume that potential reporting bias may have affected the share of reported agents (as displayed in Fig.\n\n2).\n\nWhile this study is the only study to date to report on specific agents of background antibiotic use at an individual level in a clinic setting, numbers for some agents were small, limiting statistical analyses for detecting associations.\n\nThird, no information was available about the exact dosage, start date, and duration.\n\nThere was also no information about whether a client currently used antibiotics or had stopped more than a week ago.\n\nIn clinical practice, it would be useful to know whether treatment was current or less recent.\n\nWhen designing future studies, these issues need to be taken into account, for example, by prospective systematic assessment of antibiotic consumption by a trained interviewer.\n\nWhen available, a review of prescribing records would limit the flaws introduced by self-reports.\n\nFourth, it is likely that nongenital infections were missed as anorectal or oropharyngeal C.\n\ntrachomatis and that N.\n\ngonorrhoeae was not tested in all individuals, possible attenuating associations with antibiotic use.\n\nHowever, potential underestimation of risk estimates is likely minimal, as restricting the data to people tested at all anatomic sites revealed highly similar results (i.e., for women the OR was 0.86 [95% CI, 0.50 to 1.49; total group OR,1.09], for heterosexual men it was 0.86 [95% CI, 0.34 to 2.20; total group OR, 0.74], and for MSM it was 0.42 [95% CI, 0.22 to 0.82; total group OR, 0.49]).\n\nIn conclusion, recent antibiotic use is common; one of eight clinic patients reported it before being screened for STI.\n\nTetracyclines are associated with a lower C.\n\ntrachomatis prevalence, while there is a notable absence of an association between C.\n\ntrachomatis and azithromycin.\n\nSome patients who tested positive for C.\n\ntrachomatis and N.\n\ngonorrhoeae had very recently been treated with antibiotics, so possible interactions with current clinic treatments need to be carefully considered.\n\nStill, a large part of the reported antibiotics are not first-line treatments against C.\n\ntrachomatis or N.\n\ngonorrhoeae.\n\nThe impact of background antibiotic use on STI clinic practice seems to be relatively limited, although that may be different in countries with a higher background antibiotic consumption.\n\nPrevious SectionNext Section ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank the staff of the STI clinic, Helen Sijstermans (Health Service South Limburg), and Kevin Theunissen (Health Service South Limburg)

{"content": "Abstract Background The duration of antibiotic treatment of exacerbations of COPD (ECOPD) is controversial.\n\nSerum procalcitonin (PCT) is a biomarker of bacterial infection used to identify the cause of ECOPD.\n\nMethods and Findings We investigated whether a PCT-guided plan would allow a shorter duration of antibiotic treatment in patients with severe ECOPD.\n\nFor this multicenter, randomized, non-inferiority trial, we enrolled 184 patients hospitalized with ECOPD from 18 hospitals in Italy.\n\nPatients were assigned to receive antibiotics for 10 days (standard group) or for either 3 or 10 days (PCT group).\n\nThe primary outcome was the rate of ECOPD at 6 months.\n\nHaving planned to recruit 400 patients, we randomized only 183: 93 in the PCT group and 90 in the standard group.\n\nThus, the completed study was underpowered.\n\nThe ECOPD rate at 6 months between PCT-guided and standard antibiotic treatment was not significant (% difference, 4.04; 90% confidence interval [CI], \u22127.23 to 15.31), but the CI included the non-inferiority margin of 15.\n\nIn the PCT-guided group, about 50% of patients were treated for 3 days, and there was no difference in primary or secondary outcomes compared to patients treated for 10 days.\n\nConclusions Although the primary and secondary clinical outcomes were no different for patients treated for 3 or 10 days in the PCT group, the conclusion that antibiotics can be safely stopped after 3 days in patients with low serum PCT cannot be substantiated statistically.\n\nThus, the results of this study are inconclusive regarding the noninferiority of the PCT-guided plan compared to the standard antibiotic treatment.\n\nThe study was funded by Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco

with a mortality rate as high as 40% in the first year following hospitalization in patients needing mechanical support for acute ECOPD [2].\n\nThe most common causes of ECOPD are viral and/or bacterial respiratory tract infections and air pollution.\n\nHowever, a precise cause cannot be identified in a large number of patients [1\u20134].\n\nLong-term antibiotic treatment (e.g., 12 months of 250 mg azithromycin daily) prevents ECOPD and hospitalization in patients with severe COPD [5,6], possibly by reducing the bacterial load and/or bronchial inflammation in the airways.\n\nHowever, it may also increase bacterial resistance, cardiovascular mortality due to prolongation of the heart rate-corrected QT (QTc) interval [7], and hearing loss.\n\nThus, long-term antibiotic treatment is not recommended by most recent international guidelines [8].\n\nThe current approach to treatment of ECOPD due to bacterial infections is antibiotic treatment, even though the precise role of bacterial infections and antibiotic treatment in individual episodes of severe ECOPD remains controversial [9,10].\n\nIdentification of the bacterial etiology of ECOPD is often unclear, and the decision to treat with antibiotics is usually empirical; antibiotics are, of course, useful only for treating bacterial infections.\n\nTaking into account the limited evidence available, i.e., that from only one properly designed randomized clinical trial [11], current international guidelines recommend antibiotics only in ECOPD with (i) three cardinal symptoms, i.e., increased dyspnea, sputum volume, and sputum purulence (type 1) [11] or (ii) two cardinal symptoms, with one of the two being sputum purulence (type 2), and/or (iii) respiratory failure [11] with an arbitrary duration of 5\u201310 days [8,12].\n\nPrevious studies investigated the role of biomarkers of bacterial infection [13\u201315], particularly procalcitonin (PCT), in guiding antibiotic treatment in respiratory infections, i.e., pneumonia and ECOPD [16\u201320].\n\nPCT is a prototype of a \u201chormokine\u201d mediator that is released in bacterial infections but not in viral infections or noninfectious stimuli [21].\n\nIndeed, PCT-guided antibiotic treatment may reduce the use of antibiotics in patients hospitalized for ECOPD [17,19,20].\n\nHowever, none of those studies consisted only of patients with Anthonisen\u2019s type 1 ECOPD [11] or respiratory failure, for whom guidelines recommend antibiotic treatment [8,12], and none investigated the role of PCT in reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment.\n\nAntibiotic treatment for up to 10 days is supported by a single clinical trial published 28 years ago_[11]; in fact, both the previous (3\u201310 days) [22] and current (5\u201310 days) recommendations [8,12] have been given only a D level of evidence, i.e., panel consensus judgment.\n\nAlso, although GOLD guidelines only mention PCT as a biomarker of bacterial infection_ [8], a recent JAMA clinical evidence synopsis [23] does not recommend its use.\n\nFor all these reasons, we decided to investigate whether antibiotic treatment could be safely stopped according to a PCT-guided 3-day treatment plan in patients hospitalized with ECOPD.\n\nMethods Study Design and Participants The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see S7 CONSORT Checklist and S8 Protocol.\n\nIn a randomized, multicenter, open, controlled, parallel-group, noninferiority trial involving 18 university/city hospital pulmonary departments, we compared patients hospitalized with severe ECOPD who were receiving the standard 10-day course of antibiotic therapy recommended by the 2005 GOLD guidelines [22] with those receiving a 3- or 10-day antibiotic course guided by a PCT plan.\n\nAccording to current recommendations [22, 24], because all patients recruited for the study required hospitalization, the exacerbations were considered severe.\n\nApart from the usual clinical investigations, which included routine blood tests, arterial blood gases, ECG, and chest X-ray, no other specific clinical investigation was used to assess the severity of exacerbations.\n\nPatients were recruited and followed up between 26 January 2007 and 25 July 2011.\n\nStudy participants were male or female, \u226518 years of age, current or former smokers, and diagnosed with COPD stages I-IV as defined by GOLD guidelines available at the time the study was designed, with protocol deviation [22].\n\nPatients were hospitalized for severe ECOPD requiring antibiotic treatment, i.e., type 1 exacerbation (increased dyspnea, sputum volume, and sputum purulence verified by the attending clinician) according to Anthonisen [11], and/or characterized by respiratory failure.\n\nECOPD was defined as \u201can acute event characterized by a worsening of the patient\u2019s respiratory symptoms that is beyond normal day-to-day variations and leads to a change in medication\u201d [22,24].\n\nExclusion criteria included bronchial asthma, unstable concomitant disease (cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, neurological, metabolic, musculoskeletal, neoplastic, respiratory or other disease), pregnancy and breastfeeding, clinically significant laboratory abnormalities suggestive of unstable concomitant disease, survival for 1 year unlikely, and inability to give written consent.\n\nAntibiotic pretreatment before hospital admission and radiographic signs of pneumonia did not preclude eligibility for the study.\n\nAll patients underwent chest X-ray at admission.\n\nOnly one patient recruited in the standard group had community-acquired pneumonia, and remained in the study group.\n\nPatients\u2019 clinical data, comorbidities, and routine blood test results were recorded at the time of recruitment.\n\nAccording to the protocol, all patients had to have a record of lung function testing confirming COPD (see below) or spirometric tests in the hospital according to guidelines [25].\n\nAll patients included in the analysis had hospital spirometry.\n\nPatients were included in the study if they had a FEV1/FVC <0.7 and FEV1 <80% predicted [8,22].\n\nIn addition, all patients underwent arterial blood gas analysis at admission, on Day 1, and on Day 2.\n\nRespiratory failure was defined as PaO2 <60 mm Hg with or without PaCO2 >50 mm Hg when breathing room air [8,22].\n\nThe study (which conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki) was approved by the ethics committees of each of the 18 participating centers.\n\nNames of members of the ethics committee/institutional review board(s) that approved the study are reported in Supporting Information.\n\nAll patients gave informed written consent.\n\nThe trial was approved and funded by the Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco (AIFA), the Italian agency for drugs that is an official body of the Italian Ministry of Health.\n\nThe title of the protocol, approval and funding were registered in the AIFA registry (http://www.agenziafarmaco.gov.it/, <http://www.agenziaitalianadelfarmaco.gov.it,farm58j2xh/> FARM58J2XH) and the protocol was posted by AIFA in the European clinical trials register (https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/search, 2006-005354-68) on 2007/07/04.\n\nThe trial was registered by us at http://www.clinicaltrial.gov/ (NCT01125098) in 2010.\n\nThe reason for the late registration at http://www.clinicaltrial.gov was that we thought that registration in the https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/search represented sufficient evidence of trial publication.\n\nWe confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this drug/intervention are registered.\n\nRandomization and Treatment The independent Clinical Trials and Methodological Unit at the University of Modena carried out centralized randomization.\n\nEligible patients were randomly assigned to receive standard antibiotic therapy (standard group) or PCT-guided antibiotic treatment (PCT group) according to a 1:1 permuted block computer-generated scheme, stratified according to hospital.\n\nThe randomization was Web-based, and only statisticians and the website administrator knew the randomization sequence.\n\nOn admission, all patients received a 3-day course of antibiotics (either amoxicillin plus clavulanate or quinolones) according to 2005 international guidelines [22].\n\nPCT levels were measured on hospital admission, on Day 1, and on Day 2.\n\nOn Day 2 each eligible patient was randomly assigned to one of the two treatment plans.\n\nPatients randomized to the standard group continued antibiotic therapy for 10 days, whereas patients randomized to the PCT group either continued treatment for 10 days or stopped on Day 3, depending on their PCT levels, according to previously recommended cut-off values [17,20].\n\nSpecifically, patients continued antibiotic treatment for 10 days if one or more of the PCT values on the first 3 days of hospitalization were \u22650.25 \u03bcg/L.\n\nWhen PCT values were <0.25 \u03bcg/L but \u22650.1 \u03bcg/L on any occasion, antibiotic treatment was continued for 10 days, but only if patients 0were clinically unstable or had acute respiratory failure; otherwise, treatment was stopped on Day 3.\n\nIf all PCT values were consistently <0.1 \u03bcg/L, treatment was stopped on Day 3 (Fig.\n\n1).\n\nBecause the final decision about maximum duration of treatment in randomized patients was left to the referring investigator, who had the option of overruling the PCT-guided plan if he or she deemed it clinically inappropriate, 4 patients with low values of PCT received treatment between 4 and 10 days.\n\nAll patients were also treated with (i) systemic corticosteroids for 14 days [22], plus (ii) regular inhaled short-acting or long-acting bronchodilators.\n\nDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Fig 1.\n\nTrial protocol.\n\nSevere disease = respiratory failure or clinical instability.\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0118241.g001 Outcomes and Follow-up We prospectively followed patients during hospitalization and after discharge.\n\nPatients were clinically assessed on admission, on Days 1 and 2 after hospitalization, and on Day 10 or at discharge.\n\nBlood samples were obtained for measurement of PCT and serologic testing (Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila [Virotech ELISA IgG and IgM; Vircell ELISA IgG and IgM; Virion Serion ELISA classic IgG and IgM]).\n\nSputum was collected for Gram staining and culture.\n\nMicrobiological analysis was carried out according to Isenberg [26], and all patients had a chest X-ray.\n\nOnly one patient in the standard group had radiological evidence of pneumonia, and he was negative for serological detection of bacterial infection.\n\nIn addition, each patient filled out quality-of-life questionnaires (Short Form 36, baseline [BDI] and transition [TDI] dyspnea indices, and CCIQ [Chronic Cough Impact Questionnaire]) on admission [27\u201330].\n\nFollow-up visits were scheduled on Day 1, Day 3, and 6 months after discharge; telephone interviews were conducted at 2, 4, and 5 months after discharge.\n\nThe primary end point of the study was the percentage of patients with at least one exacerbation within 6 months after the index exacerbation.\n\nSecondary end points included hospital readmission, admission to the intensive care unit, change in lung function (\u0394FEV1), length of hospital stay, and death from any cause.\n\nThe outcome of the index exacerbation was considered a clinical success when the signs and symptoms associated with the exacerbation were completely resolved or improved.\n\nTreatment failure was defined as a lack of resolution, lack of attenuation of signs and symptoms, worsening of signs and symptoms, or death.\n\nThe patient\u2019s safety was monitored at each visit, including the assessment of adverse events related to the antibiotic treatment and of clinical events such as pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, acute pulmonary edema, and any cardiovascular accident.\n\nMeasurement of Procalcitonin Quantitative measurements of PCT concentrations were performed in a centralized laboratory (Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Padova, Italy), in duplicate in human serum samples (volume: 50 \u03bcL), using an automated immunofluorescent assay (Kryptor PCT; Brahms Diagnostica AG, Hennigsdorf/Berlin, Germany).\n\nThe principle of the method is based on TRACE technology (time-resolved amplification of cryptate emission), which measures the signal emitted from an immunocomplex with time delay.\n\nThe basis of TRACE technology is nonradiating energy transfer from a donor molecule (cryptate) to a fluorescent label (XL665) acceptor molecule; the long-life signal emitted is proportional to the concentration of the analyte to be measured (PCT) [31].\n\nThe characteristics of the test have been previously described [17,20].\n\nSamples were couriered from each participating center to the Central Laboratory of Padova with the commitment to deliver the results of the 3-day samples within 24 hours of the previous sample.\n\nStatistical Analysis Sample size was determined according to the primary outcome of the study (cumulative ECOPD rate at 6 months), calculated by dividing the number of patients with at least one exacerbation during the 6-month follow-up by the total number of patients initially randomized.\n\nData from previous studies [20], used to estimate the frequency of the primary outcome of the present study, suggested that exacerbations within 6 months occur in approximately 50% of patients.\n\nTo define the noninferiority of the PCT-guided algorithm compared to the standard guidelines-recommended plan, we settled on a 15% difference in the percentage of patients with an exacerbation within the 6-month follow-up as a clinically tolerable upper limit.\n\nWe hypothesized that exacerbation rates for both treatment plans would be equal (at 50%), and we considered a difference of \u226415% to be irrelevant; then, setting \u03b2 = 0.20 and \u03b1 = 0.05 (one-tail), the estimated sample size was 140 patients per arm.\n\nTaking into account an estimated 30% drop-out rate of patients at the 6-month follow-up, we increased the sample size to 200 patients per arm.\n\nData were summarized as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD), or as median and interquartile range (IQR) when appropriate, for continuous variables or as number and percentage for categorical variables.\n\nTo compare PCT-guided and standard groups in terms of primary outcome, we estimated the risk difference and its relative 90% confidence interval (CI).\n\nFor secondary outcomes, risks and mean differences as well as their 95% CIs were calculated for comparing binary and continuous outcomes, respectively.\n\nHazard ratios and their 95% CIs were estimated to compare time-to-event data.\n\nCategorical data were compared with the use of the chi-square test or the Fisher exact test, when appropriate.\n\nContinuous data were compared with the use of Student\u2019s t test.\n\nCox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% CIs for time-to-event data (e.g., length of hospital stay).\n\nStatistical analyses were performed by using STATA version 12 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX).\n\nResults Study Population We planned to recruit 400 patients.\n\nHowever, because of slow recruitment by the centers and possibly because of the very strict inclusion criteria (Anthonisen type 1 and/or respiratory failure), we were able to screen only

mistake; they actually did not meet the inclusion criteria.\n\nNo patient in the standard group was lost to follow-up.\n\nAccording to the protocol, within the PCT group, 45 patients stopped antibiotics after a 3-day course, and 43 patients continued antibiotics for 10 days.\n\nClinical characteristics of the study participants were similar in all groups (Table 1).\n\nOverall, 18.5% of all patients received antibiotics before admission, with no difference between groups (p = 0.481), and the duration of antibiotic treatment was similar even in the subgroups (p = 0.942).\n\nUse of other medications prescribed before admission was no different between groups (Table 1).\n\nFEV1 (% of predicted value) was similar in the two groups (41.3% in the PCT group and 42.7% in the standard group; p = 0.597).\n\nOverall, 80% of patients (78% in the standard group and 83% in the PCT group; p = 0.385) had relevant comorbidities.\n\nDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF

serological detection of bacterial infection.\n\nOn admission, the median PCT level (IQR) was 0.12 \u03bcg/L (25th-75th centile, 0.08\u20130.18) in the standard group, 0.21 \u03bcg/L (0.13\u20130.57) in the PCT subgroup who continued antibiotics for 10 days, and 0.08 \u03bcg/L (0.06\u20130.12) in the PCT subgroup who stopped antibiotics after 3 days.\n\nAs expected, PCT levels decreased on Day 1

though evidence for both the bacterial etiology and the efficacy of antibiotic treatment in ECOPD is still controversial.\n\nThe recognition of clinical/biochemical characteristics that would (i) identify patients with ECOPD due to bacterial infection, (ii) select patients who could most benefit from antibiotic treatment, and (iii) determine the appropriate duration of antibiotic treatment would improve ECOPD management and reduce antibiotic use.\n\nThe results of our study failed to demonstrate the noninferiority of PCT-guided antibiotic treatment compared to standard treatment, even though the difference in the upper limit of the 90% CI (15.31) went just slightly beyond the predefined non-inferiority margin (15.31 versus 15).\n\nHowever, we found no significant difference in primary or secondary outcomes between the PCT and standard groups and, more important, between the patients who received antibiotics for 3 days and those who received antibiotics for 10 days.\n\nThus, the results of this study suggest that, in a subject with low levels of PCT, the duration of antibiotic treatment might safely be reduced to 3 days.\n\nEven if a properly designed and powered study is required for corroboration before a specific recommendation can be made, our results are consistent with the efficacy and safety of the PCT-guided antibiotic treatment plan recently suggested in two important articles, i.e., a Cochrane review [32] and an authoritative synopsis of clinical evidence [23].\n\nOur study has several limitations.\n\nFirst, it was underpowered, because we planned to enroll 400 patients and eventually randomized only 183.\n\nThus, the conclusion that antibiotics can be safely stopped after 3 days in patients with low serum PCT cannot be substantiated statistically.\n\nSecond, we arbitrarily decided on a 10-day duration for the standard group even though the 2005 guidelines recommended 3\u201310 days [22].\n\nThis decision was made because of the severity of ECOPD, which in our study required hospitalization.\n\nThird, the calculation of the sample was based on a 50% re-exacerbation risk at 6 months according to a previous similar study [20], whereas the incidence we observed in the standard group was 27.78%.\n\nWe can only speculate on this discrepancy, but we believe that the lower incidence at 6 months might have been due to two major differences in our study compared to the previous study: (1) We included only patients with either all three criteria of Anthonisen (increased dyspnea, sputum volume, and sputum purulence) or respiratory failure; and (2) we treated all patients for 10 days with full-dose inhaled bronchodilator/combination therapy and a course of oral steroids.\n\nFourth, because we anticipated that the primary outcome (exacerbations of COPD) would be strong and easy to identify, and thus unlikely to be biased by investigator influence, we did not adopt any procedure to reduce bias during the follow-up part of the trial.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, this study is the first randomized multicenter clinical trial testing a PCT-guided antibiotic treatment plan to include only hospitalized patients with severe ECOPD with clinical characteristics requiring antibiotic treatment according to guidelines [8,22].\n\nPrevious studies have tested the PCT-guided antibiotic treatment plan in patients hospitalized because of lower respiratory infections and/or ECOPD, but none has specifically included only patients with type 1 Anthonisen\u2019s ECOPD and/or respiratory failure requiring antibiotic treatment [16,17,19,20].\n\nIn addition, all previous studies were designed and powered to assess the effect of a PCT plan on the prescription/exposure of patients to antibiotics, and were not designed and powered on clinical outcomes.\n\nAlso, none of the previous studies investigated the role of a PCT-guided plan for deciding the duration of treatment with antibiotics.\n\nTherefore, previous studies could not provide evidence to support or modify the current guidelines regarding duration of antibiotic treatment [8].\n\nIn contrast with previous studies, our study was conducted only in patients with clinical characteristics requiring antibiotics, and thus could provide novel evidence about the role of a PCT-guided plan to decide the duration of antibiotic treatment, even though\u2014because of lack of statistical significance regarding noninferiority\u2014our study cannot be considered conclusive.\n\nAnother strength of our study that was inconsistently present in previous studies is that, according to guidelines, all patients were given oral or intravenous corticosteroids and inhaled bronchodilators for at least 3 days.\n\nThis allowed us to properly investigate the effects of antibiotics in addition to bronchodilator and steroid treatment.\n\nSurprisingly, considering the entry criteria, the prevalence of positive cultures from sputum was low (17%) compared to previously reported data (32%) [33].\n\nWe do not have a clear explanation for this discrepancy.\n\nIn conclusion, because of the low statistical power of our study, the results leave us with uncertainty about the role of PCT-guided antibiotic treatment in deciding the duration of antibiotic treatment for patients hospitalized with severe ECOPD.\n\nPCT may help to identify patients in whom a shorter duration of antibiotic treatment could be safely prescribed, but adequately powered studies are needed to affirm this possibility.\n\nSupporting InformationS1 CONSORT

{"content": "Abstract Background Between 19%-44% pregnant women are prescribed antibiotics during pregnancy.\n\nA single, large randomised-controlled-trial (ORACLE Childhood Study II) found an increased risk of childhood cerebral palsy and possibly epilepsy following prophylactic antibiotic use in pregnant women with spontaneous preterm labour.\n\nWe ascertained whether this outcome could be reproduced across the population of babies delivered at term and prospectively followed in primary-care using data from The Health Improvement Network.\n\nMethods We determined the risk of cerebral palsy or epilepsy in children whose mothers were prescribed antibiotics during pregnancy using a cohort of 195,909 women linked to their live, term-born, singleton children.\n\nWe compared the effect of antibiotic class, number of courses and timing of prescribing in pregnancy.\n\nAnalyses were adjusted for maternal risk factors (e.g. recorded infection, age, chronic conditions, social

are one of the most frequently prescribed medications in pregnancy, with estimates of antibiotic use in pregnancy ranging from 19% to 44%.[1\u20136] When deciding whether to taken any form of pharmacologic treatment during pregnancy, women (and the healthcare professionals treating them) need to be sure that overall benefits outweigh potential harm to the fetus.[7,8] There is strong evidence for net benefits of prenatal antibiotics for mother and child when infection is the predominant underlying mechanism of effect.\n\nFor example, prenatal antibiotics are effective for women with suspected bacterial infections (e.g urinary tract infections [UTI][9]) and as prophylaxis for women with asymptomatic bacteriuria[10] and preterm prolonged rupture of membranes.[11] Unexpected evidence of harm associated with prenatal antibiotics was provided by a single large (N>4,000) randomised-controlled-trial (RCT) of prophylactic antibiotics for women in spontaneous preterm labour.[12] This trial, the Oracle Childhood Study (OCS) II, evaluated children at the age of seven years whose mothers had been randomised to receive erythromycin, co-amoxiclav, both, or placebo during pregnancy.\n\nMost children were born at term and were delivered greater than seven days after trial entry.[12] Women who received both erythromycin and co-amoxiclav had an increased risk of having a child with cerebral palsy (odds ratio [OR]: 2.93; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.50\u20135.65) or epilepsy (OR: 1.53; 95%CI: 1.07\u20132.20) compared to women randomised to receive placebo.[12\u201314] These findings may be explained by harm due to antibiotics, possibly from prolonged exposure to inflammatory processes in the intrauterine environment due to partially treated infection.[15] Alternatively, the apparent adverse effect of antibiotics may be explained by biases due to \u2018damaged-survivors\u2019 in analyses that were conditioned on survivors of infancy\u2014where stillbirths, infant deaths and children lost-to-follow up were excluded.[16] Antibiotics are now not recommended for women in preterm labour without overt evidence of infection and further RCTs to confirm or refute the findings of OCS II are unlikely.[17] Large, longitudinal primary-care databases are widely used to investigate drug safety and are particularly useful for exploring unexpected adverse effects.[18] We therefore analysed primary-care data to determine whether antibiotic prescribing (for any indication) during pregnancy was associated with cerebral palsy or epilepsy in children and whether risk of cerebral palsy or epilepsy varied according to the timing, number of courses, and class of antibiotic prescribed.\n\nWe hypothesised that there would be no association between prenatal antibiotic prescribing and cerebral palsy and/or epilepsy in childhood.\n\nMETHODS Data Source We used The Health Improvement Network (THIN) which captures prospective, anonymised data on prescriptions, diagnoses, and symptoms in primary-care for approximately 6% of the United Kingdom population.[19] Prescription data are automatically recorded when prescriptions are issued, and they are classified according to the British National Formulary (BNF).[20,21] Significant medical events are recorded by clinicians and coded using the Read system.[22] Data on contact with secondary-care and socio-demographic status are also available.\n\nTHIN is broadly representative of the UK population and captures valid and complete data.[23\u201327] Study design We analysed a retrospective cohort of women who were linked to their live-born children using deterministic (exact) linkage methods.\n\nThe following variables were considered when linking mothers and children: family ID number, mother\u2019s actual or estimated date of delivery, child\u2019s month and/or year of birth, and gestational age at delivery/birth.\n\nParticipants Inception to the cohort was restricted to women aged 15\u201350 years between January 1990 and May 2010, who had registered at their primary-care practice before pregnancy and who had a singleton, child born at or after term (37 weeks of gestation or more).\n\nWhere gestational age at delivery was uncertain and evidence of pre- or post-term birth was lacking (37%), we assumed pregnancy lasted 40 weeks.\n\nFor women with multiple pregnancies (approximately 24% in the cohort), we randomly selected one pregnancy for analysis.\n\nChildren born preterm were excluded because their increased risk of cerebral palsy and epilepsy (related to prenatal, perinatal and postnatal risk factors) could mask any association with antibiotic prescribing in pregnancy.\n\nFor consistency with the OCS II study[12], follow-up ended at the earliest of seven completed years of age, the date the child left their primary-care practice, death, or the end of the study (May 2010).\n\nAntibiotic prescriptions We considered women as treated if they had a prescription record between the last menstrual period and estimated delivery date for any antibiotic in chapter 5.1 of the British National Formulary (BNF), excluding those with topical formulations such as antibiotics used to treat acne (BNF chapter 13.6.1) and conjunctivitis (BNF chapter 11.3.1).\n\nA list of the generic antibiotics considered is provided in S1 Appendix\u2014Codes used to identify women with antibiotic prescriptions in pregnancy.\n\nAll other women were considered as untreated.\n\nAntibiotics prescribed and dispensed by hospitals are not captured in THIN, but are likely to affect very few women in this study.\n\nExcept for women whose illness or labour requires hospital care, treatment would normally be prescribed by the primary-care practitioner.\n\nIntrapartum antibiotic prescribing has been estimated to involve less than 5% of women, including those delivering preterm.[28] Cerebral palsy or epilepsy The pre-specified primary outcome was cerebral palsy and/or epilepsy recorded in a child\u2019s primary-care record up to seven years old.\n\nWe grouped cerebral palsy and epilepsy for the following reasons: 1.\n\nthey often co-occur; 2.\n\nthey have common prenatal aetiologies; 3.\n\nthey were associated with prenatal antibiotic prescribing in the OCS II study; and 4.\n\nto increase statistical power for our analyses of timing, number of courses and type of antibiotic prescribed.\n\nWe used a previously published and validated algorithm to identify children with epilepsy which was based on one or more codes for an epilepsy diagnosis, symptoms (multiple seizure records), and on-going treatment (repeated prescriptions for anti-epileptic drugs).[29] Further details, and code lists, are provided in S2 Appendix\u2014Description of algorithm and codes used to identify children with epilepsy.\n\nA similar algorithm was developed to identify children with cerebral palsy, whereby codes for diagnoses, symptoms (e.g. spasticity), treatment (e.g. intramuscular injection of baclofen) and management procedures (e.g. tenotomy) were used to identify children with possible cerebral palsy.\n\nWe then reviewed the full medical records of all children with possible cerebral palsy and excluded (from consideration as a child with cerebral palsy) those without consistent evidence of a non-progressive motor disorder.\n\nAll reviewers were blinded as to whether a child\u2019s mother was prescribed antibiotics during pregnancy.\n\nAdditional details are available in S3 Appendix\u2014Description of algorithm and codes used to identify children with cerebral palsy.\n\nThe outcome date was the earliest date upon which evidence for cerebral palsy or epilepsy was recorded.\n\nMaternal risk factors for both antibiotic prescribing in pregnancy and cerebral palsy and/or epilepsy in the child We classified the following maternal risk factors: maternal age at delivery, pregnancy complications (e.g. any record indicating hypertension or diabetes), chronic conditions (e.g. obesity prior to pregnancy [BMI\u226530 or Read code for obesity], treatment for chronic medical conditions during pregnancy)[30], behaviours (e.g. recent smoking/tobacco use, alcohol or illicit drug misuse at any time), social deprivation (measured by the Townsend score quintile where Q1 is most affluent and Q5 is most deprived [31]), maternal infection that was a potentially neurologically-damaging infection (PNDI) for the fetus (e.g. UTIs and chorioamnionitis; see S4 Appendix\u2014Read codes used to identify women with potentially neurologically-damaging infections in pregnancy).[32,33] These maternal risk factors were chosen a priori based on evidence from the literature of associations between these factors and both our exposure and outcomes of interest.\n\nWe assumed that absence of codes for maternal conditions indicated absence of those conditions.\n\nAnalysis We used a series of Cox regression models to compare the time to cerebral palsy and/or epilepsy in different groups of women who were and were not prescribed antibiotics in pregnancy.\n\nIn the primary analysis we compared children whose mothers received one or more antibiotic prescriptions with those whose mothers had no recorded antibiotic prescription.\n\nAdjustment was made for potential maternal confounders using the propensity score for antibiotic prescribing.\n\nThis was derived using all maternal risk factors (for antibiotic prescribing and for having a child with cerebral palsy and/or epilepsy) listed previously as well as calendar year of delivery.[34] Ten women with non-overlapping propensity score distributions were trimmed from the analysis cohort.\n\nWe further adjusted this and all other analyses for potential clustering at the level of primary-care practice by using robust standard errors.\n\nAssumptions of proportional hazards were met for this and all other models.\n\nIn a sensitivity analysis (designed to minimise bias due to the type of infection for which antibiotics were prescribed\u2014not to minimise bias due to infection severity) we repeated the above analysis using a restricted cohort which included women with a single respiratory tract infection recorded in pregnancy and compared children whose mothers received an antibiotic prescription for a respiratory tract infection with children whose mothers were not prescribed antibiotics for their respiratory tract infection.\n\nWomen with respiratory tract infections in pregnancy were identified using Read codes\u2014details are provided in S5 Appendix\u2014Read codes used to identify women with respiratory tract infections in pregnancy.\n\nIn secondary analyses we determined the effect of number, timing and type of antibiotic prescriptions in pregnancy on the time to cerebral palsy and/or epilepsy.\n\nTo assess the effect of number of courses of antibiotics prescribed (where each separate prescription was defined as a single course), we categorised the variable for antibiotic treatment into a four-level variable (none, one, two or three or more courses).\n\nWe determined the association with the class (type) and timing of antibiotic prescription in analyses restricted to women prescribed a single course of antibiotics.\n\nClass of antibiotic was grouped according to BNF sub-chapters (e.g. penicillins, aminoglycosides, macrolides, tetracyclines).\n\nPencillins were chosen as the referent group because they were the most commonly prescribed class of antibiotics in pregnancy and have the longest history of safe use in pregnancy.\n\nTo assess timing, we categorised prescriptions within four week periods (lunar month) of gestational age.\n\nHere, the first lunar month was arbitrarily chosen as the referent group.\n\nIn all secondary analyses, we accounted for potential confounding using a stepwise approach to model building, as propensity scores are only valid with binary exposure variables.\n\nNumbers needed to harm were estimated at age seven years using methods of Altman et al.[35] Finally, in post-hoc analyses requested by a reviewer, we repeated the primary analysis (any versus no antibiotic) and one secondary analysis (class of antibiotic versus penicillins) on risk of epilepsy.\n\nAll authors designed the study.\n\nWM performed the analyses, with input and advice from RG.\n\nCode lists were reviewed by GPs, a paediatrician (RG), and an epileptologist.\n\nEthics Statement Research using data from THIN has blanket ethics approval from the South East Multi-Centre Research Ethics Committee.\n\nAll data in THIN are anonymised and researchers do not have access to any identifiable information such as names, NHS numbers, postcodes or full birthdays.\n\nThis study received additional approval from the THIN scientific review committee (13_008).\n\nRESULTSWe identified a cohort of 195,909 women linked to their singleton children born at or after term.\n\nThe cohort comprised all mother-child pairs in THIN meeting the study eligibility criteria.\n\nThe children were followed up from birth for a median of 3.6 years (inter quartile range [IQR] 1.5\u20137.2).\n\nMedian follow-up differed by outcome status\u2014children with cerebral palsy and/or epilepsy were followed-up for 6.5 years (IQR 3.5\u201310.3) whilst children without were followed-up for 3.7 years (IQR 1.6\u20137.2).\n\nIn total, 1,170 (0.6%) children had evidence of cerebral palsy (n = 232), epilepsy (n = 874) or both (n = 64) in their medical records, and 64,623 (33%) were prescribed antibiotics during pregnancy.\n\nCompared to women not prescribed antibiotics, women prescribed antibiotics (Table 1) were on average more deprived, more likely to be obese (15.5% vs 10.9%), to receive treatment for chronic medical conditions in pregnancy (14.9% vs 9.2%), to have problems with alcohol (1.7% vs 1.1%) to use tobacco (28.6% vs 21.5%) or illicit drugs (1.6% vs 0.9%), and to have an infection which could potentially cause fetal neuro-damage (23.2% vs 4.2%).\n\nDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Table

those prescribed penicillins (Table 3).\n\nThe incidence of cerebral palsy or epilepsy in children whose mothers were prescribed macrolides was 254.6 per 100,000 CYAR (95%CI 175.6\u2013368.3) compared to 143.6 (95%CI 122.8\u2013169.0) in children whose mothers were prescribed penicillin.\n\nThe number need to harm was 153 (95%CI 71\u2013671) at age seven years.\n\nThe post-hoc analysis which looked at epilepsy as the outcome, found that macrolide versus penicillin prescribing in pregnancy was associated with a doubling in the risk of epilepsy in childhood (adj.HR 2.02; 95%CI 1.30\u20133.14; p = 0.002).\n\nDISCUSSIONWe found no evidence for an increased risk of cerebral palsy and/or epilepsy in children of women prescribed any antibiotics in pregnancy compared with no antibiotics after taking into account maternal risk factors for treatment.\n\nChildren of women prescribed three courses or more of antibiotics compared with none did have an increased risk of cerebral palsy or epilepsy which may reflect the risks associated with recurrent infections.\n\nWe also found an increased risk of cerebral palsy or epilepsy in children of women prescribed macrolides compared with penicillins.\n\nStrengths of our study are the large cohort, the fact that THIN captures all primary-care prescribing (though not dispensing), and the longitudinal records allowing follow up into childhood.\n\nOne weakness, inherent in observational studies, is confounding of the relationship between antibiotic prescribing and childhood cerebral palsy or epilepsy by maternal risk factors (such as parity which is not reliably recorded in UK primary care), and particularly by maternal infections that indicated antibiotic treatment.\n\nWe adjusted analyses for maternal risk factors including maternal infections for which there was evidence of an association with fetal neuro-damage (PNDI).\n\nWe considered maternal infection to be a confounder in the analyses as there is evidence from numerous studies that certain maternal infections cause fetal neurological damage[32,33] and mothers with infections are more likely to receive antibiotics.\n\nFailure to adjust for maternal infections can produce spurious associations that reflect the infection not the treatment.\n\nFor example, two Danish population-based studies used antibiotic prescribing in pregnancy as a proxy for maternal infection.\n\nThey reported associations between prenatal antibiotic prescribing and adverse neurological outcome in childhood, which are likely to reflect adverse effects of infections in pregnancy.[36,37] We also endeavoured to minimise the potential adverse effects of antibiotics due to their beneficial effects on infection by conducting a pre-planned sensitivity analysis restricted to women with \u2018treated\u2019 and \u2018untreated\u2019 respiratory tract infections.\n\nBecause respiratory tract infections diagnosed in primary-care are usually of viral aetiology[38], any benefits due to antibiotic treatment of bacterial respiratory tract infection would be small or negligible, thereby increasing the chance of detecting potential adverse effects of antibiotic treatment.\n\nHowever, we were unable to measure infection severity\u2014more severe infections would be linked to adverse fetal effects but would be more likely to be treated, thereby introducing bias in favour of an apparent harmful effect of antibiotics.\n\nOur comparison of different classes of antibiotics reduced confounding due to the indication for antibiotic treatment (i.e. infection) whereby an apparent association between prenatal antibiotics and adverse neurological outcome in childhood could result from the underlying infection which is a cause for both the antibiotic treatment and the brain damage manifesting as cerebral palsy and epilepsy.\n\nBy examining only patients with an antibiotic prescription (and thus a likely infection) we were able to minimise such indication bias.\n\nThis was particularly so for the comparison of macrolides versus penicillins as macrolides are used as alternative treatment for the same indications in penicillin-allergic patients.[21] Another limitation of the study is the measurement of antibiotic exposure.\n\nFirstly, we could not capture antibiotics prescribed by maternity services.\n\nThe prevalence of antibiotics prescribed intrapartum and not recorded in primary-care is estimated to be less than 5% of pregnancies[28] but is not routinely documented in national data.\n\nMisclassification of women treated by maternity services as untreated in primary-care would likely have had negligible effect due to small numbers among women delivering at or after term.\n\nSecondly, we could not measure which women actually had their prescriptions dispensed and which women took antibiotics as prescribed.\n\nFew studies have quantified non-compliance in pregnancy, though this may be as high as 39%.[39] Our two-step approach to identifying children with cerebral palsy and epilepsy combined a sensitive algorithm with manual review of full medical records to ensure we only classified cases based on patterns of care in the longitudinal record that were consistent with cerebral palsy or epilepsy.\n\nOur criteria were highly specific so it is possible that we missed some cases.\n\nHowever, insensitive measurement of the outcome would not bias the relative effect.[40] Because antibiotics are frequently used in pregnancy, prescribing of antibiotics in primary-care is unlikely to have an impact on ascertainment of cerebral palsy or epilepsy and also unlikely to bias length of follow-up with the primary-care practice.\n\nUsing a composite outcome gave our analyses greater statistical power which enabled us to explore the impact of timing, number of courses and type of antibiotic prescribed.\n\nDisadvantages of using a composite outcome include the difficulty of determining specificity of adverse effects\u2014for cerebral palsy and/or epilepsy separately.\n\nOur post-hoc analyses suggest the findings apply to epilepsy, but further studies are needed to explore a range of neurological outcomes.\n\nMechanisms Our study was not designed to replicate the OCS II which focused on women in spontaneous preterm labour.\n\nHowever, it is intriguing that we found a similar association between maternal macrolide prescribing and cerebral palsy or epilepsy in children born at term.\n\nWe propose several potential mechanisms for adverse effects of prenatal antibiotics\u2014possibly arising from biases due to failure to account for \u2018damaged-survivors\u2019 and possibly through direct effects of macrolides.\n\nHowever, we would be cautious to draw a causal effect based on observational data.\n\nFirst, prenatal antibiotic treatment could shift the spectrum of fetal neurological-damage caused by infection towards less severe outcomes\u2014the \u2018damaged-survivor\u2019 hypothesis.\n\nThis mechanism could manifest by increased survival and less severe neurological manifestations in survivors of treated versus untreated women.\n\nIn OCS II, a shift may have affected a minority of infected and neurologically-damaged fetuses, resulting in insufficient imbalance in numbers of stillbirths, postnatal deaths or losses to follow-up (likely to be higher in more severely affected survivors[41]), to reach statistical significance.\n\nA similar selection bias may have happened in our cohort study and may have masked any benefits of prenatal antibiotics.\n\nSecond, partially treated infection may prolong exposure of the fetal brain to inflammation, thereby increasing the risk of neuro-damage.\n\nThis mechanism could be specific to macrolides if women stopped taking erythromycin because of gastrointestinal side-effects,[42,43] or because of high rates of treatment failure from macrolide-resistant bacteria[44] or due to poor transplacental passage of macrolide antibiotics (in comparison to ampicillin, [45,46] the most commonly prescribed penicillin in pregnancy in UK primary-care[47]).\n\nThird, macrolides may have a specific adverse effect on the fetus.\n\nThere is a growing body of evidence that macrolides are associated with adverse outcomes\u2014including cardiovascular events (including death) in adults [48\u201350], cardiotoxicity[51], and miscarriage[52].\n\nSome studies have observed an association with macrolides and birth defects[53\u201355], whilst others have not [56,57].\n\nThe exact mechanism for harm is unclear, though arrhythmia resulting from inhibition of a cardiac potassium channel (IKr) and prolongation of the QT interval may play a role.[58] In animal studies, drugs which block the IKr channel (e.g. macrolide antibiotics[51]) cause embryonic bradycardia, arrhythmia and cardiac arrest, even at concentrations that do not affect the maternal heart.[59] The resulting temporary hypoxia (from interrupted/decreased oxygen supply) causes tissue damage.[60] Hypoxia in the first trimester is teratogenic[61], resulting in an increased risk of transverse limb deficiencies and cardiac anomalies with IKr-blocking drugs (e.g. macrolides[53,54], clomipramine and paroxetine[62], phenytoin[61]).\n\nIn addition to teratogenic effects, hypoxia is associated with failure of the fetus to grow and thrive in the uterus,[63] which is associated with cerebral palsy.[64] Hypoxia, in association with ischaemia and/or infection, is also thought to play a role in the aetiology of cerebral palsy and epilepsy.[65\u201367] Conclusions We found no overall association between prescribing of any antibiotics during pregnancy and cerebral palsy or epilepsy in childhood.\n\nHowever, we found that prenatal prescribing of macrolides versus penicillins was associated with an increase in the relative risk of cerebral palsy or epilepsy in childhood, though the absolute risk remained low.\n\nThis finding of harm associated with macrolide use in pregnancy is consistent with findings from the OCS II trial and with findings of adverse effects in other patient groups.\n\nSupporting InformationS1

{"content": "Keywords:antibiotic effects;Escherichia coli;flow cytometryAbstractTop of pageAbstractMETHODSRESULTS AND DISCUSSIONCONCLUSIONSACKNOWLEDGMENTSLITERATURE CITEDSupporting InformationBackgroundIn this study, we check for the presence of specific resistance genes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and then we used flow cytometry (FCM) to evaluate antibiotic-induced effects in different strains of Escherichia coli (E.\n\ncoli).MethodsThe presence of resistance genes was investigated by PCR in 10 strains of E.\n\ncoli isolated from Foglia River.\n\nBacterial responses to different antibiotics were also tested with FCM techniques by evaluating both the degree of decrease in viability and the light scatter changes in all of the strains.ResultsPCR revealed that only one strain exhibits the presence of one resistance gene.\n\nDespite this, analyses of strains using FCM evidenced the presence of viable subpopulations after antibiotic treatment.\n\nFurthermore, analyses of scatter signals revealed profound changes in the Forward Scatter and Side Scatter of the bacterial populations as a consequence of antibiotic exposure, confirming the viability and membrane potential data.\n\nThe riverine strains were in general less sensitive to antibiotics than the reference strain (ATCC 25922).ConclusionsAntibiotic resistance is a widespread phenomena.\n\nThe multiparametric approach based on FCM used in this study, providing results about different aspects (cell viability, membrane potential, light scatter changes), may overcome the limitation of PCR and could represent an adequate method for the evaluation of bacteria responses to antibiotic exposure.\n\n\u00a9 2014 International Clinical Cytometry Society \u00a9 2014 International Clinical Cytometry SocietyThe widespread use of antibiotics in medical practice and their release in the environment have led to selective pressure on bacteria.\n\nThis determines the development of antibiotic resistant strains, which is a process that is enhanced by vertical and horizontal gene transfer among intra- and interspecific bacteria [1, 2].\n\nThe presence and persistence of antibiotic resistant bacteria in different environmental compartments, such as surface water, groundwater, drinking water, soil, and sewage, is a growing public health concern [3, 4] and the high incidence of resistant bacteria in water has been well documented [5-7].\n\nTraditionally, the methods used to assess antibiotic resistance are based on the evaluation of the inhibition of colony formation in agar media or the reduction of turbidity in a broth culture.\n\nSome authors have proposed the use of flow cytometry (FCM) to study the cell response after antibiotic exposure [8-10].\n\nThe analysis of: (a) scattering signals, correlated to superficial features and their internal structure, and (b) fluorescence signal measurements allow structural and/or functional cell properties to be assessed, leading to a deeper characterization of cell populations [11].\n\nMembrane potential measurement is another approach to study bacterial viability by FCM.\n\nIndeed, the damage to the cytoplasmic membrane, which is a sign of cell suffering or death, correlates with changes in the magnitude of the membrane potential [12].\n\nIn this study, we analyzed the presence of specific resistance genes in different environmental strains of Escherichia coli (E.\n\ncoli) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\n\nTo evaluate the bacterial response to antibiotic exposure and to confirm whether FCM is a reliable approach for antibiotic susceptibility evaluation, we investigated antibiotic-induced damage (viability reduction and membrane potential alterations) and light scattering signal effects in the E.\n\ncoli isolates.METHODSTop of pageAbstractMETHODSRESULTS AND DISCUSSIONCONCLUSIONSACKNOWLEDGMENTSLITERATURE CITEDSupporting InformationStrains, Antibacterial Agents, and Culture ConditionsWater samples from Foglia River were utilized to isolate E.\n\ncoli strains.\n\nE.\n\ncoli detection was performed by the membrane filtration technique following standard regulations [13].\n\nIn brief, a water volume of 100 ml was filtered through 0.45 \u00b5m pore-size filters (Millipore, Rome, Italy).\n\nThe membranes were placed onto M-Endo agar LES (Oxoid) and incubated at 36 \u00b1 1\u00b0C for 18\u201324 h.\n\nThe colonies of presumptive coliforms were transferred to confirmation media and E.\n\ncoli identification was carried out by the API 20 E System (bioM\u00e9rieux) [14].\n\nTen (named from 1 to 10) of 58 strains characterized as E.\n\ncoli were also confirmed by in situ hybridization using the Colinsitu probe [15] and tested for susceptibility to different antibiotics (ampicillin: amp, gentamicin: gen, kanamycin: kan, chloramphenicol: clor, nalidixic acid: nal, a mixture of streptomycin and penicillin: sp, and a mixture of all of the previous antibiotics: mix).\n\nA known concentration (0.5 McFarland, corresponding to approximately 1.5 \u00d7 108 cell/ml) of each strain was incubated without (untreated sample T24) and with antibiotics in a nutrient broth (amp: 20 \u00b5g/ml, gen: 30 \u00b5g/ml [16], kan: 30 \u00b5g/ml [7], clor: 30 \u00b5g/ml [7], nal: 15 \u00b5g/ml, sp: 25 \u00b5g/ml [5], and mix) at 37\u00b0C for 24 h.\n\nThe American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) strain 25922 was used as a reference strain.PCR Detection of Resistance GenesFor the PCR amplifications, frozen bacterial pellets were thawed, diluted in distilled water (1:50) and boiled for 10 min.\n\nThe raw lysate was used directly as source of template DNA in the PCR reactions.\n\nThe amplifiability of the raw lysate dilutions was assessed with the universal primers 27F and 1429R [17].The following antimicrobial resistance genes were amplified by the PCR: blaTEM (transmission electron microscopy) [18], blaSHV [16], blaCMY [19], aadA1 [20], AphA1, AphA2 [21], and qnrA [22] (all primers from Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy).The PCR were carried out in a 50 \u00b5l mixture containing 2 mM MgCl2, 80 \u00b5M of dNTPs, 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Diatheva SrL, Pesaro-Urbino, Italy), 200 nM of each primer and 2 \u00b5l of raw bacterial lysate, as follows: 7 min at 94\u00b0C, 30 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 20 s, 52\u00b0C for 20 s, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min 30 s in a GeneAmp PCR System 2400 (Applied Biosystems).Plasmid pcDNA 3.1 (Life Technologies, Catalog Number V790-20) and pCR2.1 (Life Technologies, Catalog Number K2020-20) were used as positive controls for blaTEM and AphA2 amplification, respectively.\n\nNegative controls were included in each PCR run.\n\nThe PCR product analyses were performed with 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis using a 100-bp DNA ladder (Fermentas, product code SM0321) as a size standard.Flow CytometryAnalyses were performed with a FACScalibur (Becton Dickinson, Milan, Italy) equipped with an Argon Ion Laser set at 15 mW and tuned to an excitation wavelength of 488 nm.\n\nFor the cell viability detection, two fluorochromes with a high affinity for nucleic acids were used to stain the bacterial cells: SYBR Green I (1:10,000 final concentration) (Life Technologies, Milan, Italy) and Propidium Iodide (PI, 1 \u00b5g/ml final concentration) (Life Technologies) [23, 24].\n\nThe cell count was performed by adding Cytocount\u2122 counting beads (DakoCytomation, Denmark) to the stained samples before the processing was conducted by FCM.\n\nAccompanying datasheets provide information on the exact number of beads per \u00b5l.\n\nSeparate regions containing beads and bacteria events were drawn and the number of cells per microliter was obtained using the following formula:Number of bacterial cells = (bacteria events/bead events)* (bead number/\u00b5l)* dilution factor [25].Membrane potential evaluation was performed in strains 7\u201310 and ATCC 25922.\n\nSamples were incubated for 30 min with 3,3\u2032-Diethyloxadicarbocyanine (DiOC2) (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) at a final concentration of 30 \u00b5M [12].\n\nMultiparametric analyses were performed on both scattering signals [Forward Scatter (FSC), Side Scatter (SSC)] and FL1 (BP530/30 nm to detect green fluorescence) to detect SYBR Green I fluorescence, and on FL3 (LP > 670 nm to detect red fluorescence) to detect PI or DiOC2 fluorescence.All of the data were acquired with the Cell Quest software (v3.3).The degree of viability decrease (%) was calculated according to the following formula: (1\u2013NT/NC)*100 [10], where NT is the number of SYBR Green I positive cells in the treated sample and NC is the number of SYBR Green positive cells in the untreated sample after 24 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C.Statistical AnalysisA statistical analysis of the effect of two predictive factors (bacterial strains and antibiotics) on the dependent variables (number of bacterial cells) was performed using the log10 transformed value.\n\nLog transformation was performed to prevent there being a positive correlation between the mean and standard deviation (a current case of heteroschedasticity).The statistical analysis was performed using a two-way ANOVA procedure, and multiple post hoc comparisons were conducted using the Bonferroni test.\n\nStrains were considered to be resistant when no significant (P > 0.05) decrease in viable cell concentrations could be detected with respect to the untreated sample.\n\nThe statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS 13.0 software.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTop of pageAbstractMETHODSRESULTS AND DISCUSSIONCONCLUSIONSACKNOWLEDGMENTSLITERATURE CITEDSupporting InformationThe presence of genes conferring antibiotic resistance in the examined strains was evaluated using the PCR, with raw lysates as the source of the DNA template.\n\nSeven genes coding for resistance to three families of antimicrobial agents (beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, quinolones) were chosen to determine their distributions among the 10 E.\n\ncoli isolates.\n\nThe raw lysate dilutions were successfully amplified without inhibitory effects using the universal primers 27F and 1429R.\n\nAll of the strains gave negative results for all of the genes tested, except for strain 3, which showed a blaTEM amplification product at the expected size, indicating the presence of the ampicillin resistance gene and confirming results from the FCM (see Supporting Information, Fig.\n\n1c).\n\nThe absence of the detection of other resistance genes in strains that maintained high viability numbers after antibiotic exposure could indicate that they might contain other nontested resistance genes.Figure 1.\n\nFCM representative data for E.\n\ncoli strain 3 and 8 showing a) dot plots FL1 versus FL3 of strain 3, labeled with SYBR Green I and PI, treated with different antibiotics at 24 h (gentamicin, C; chloramphenicol, D; kanamycin, E; ampicillin, F; nalidixic

with a compromised membrane, respectively; b) histograms showing membrane potential changes in strain 8 before treatment at T0(A) and after treatment with different antibiotics (B gentamicin, C chloramphenicol, D kanamycin, E ampicillin, F nalidixic acid, G streptomycin-penicillin, H mix of all) respect to the untreated sample T24.\n\nThe events in the overlay histograms were normalized.Download figure to PowerPointNucleic acid double staining by FCM evidenced both the degree of membrane damage and the change in cell numbers after antibiotic exposure of the E.\n\ncoli strains.In Figure 1a, we present an example of FCM analysis on cell viability after an antibiotic treatment (e.g., E.\n\ncoli strain 3), in which three cell populations can be distinguished: cells with an intact membrane (R2: viable), cells with a damaged membrane (R4: dead), and cells with a compromised membrane (R3: damaged).\n\nAt time 0, all of the E.\n\ncoli strains showed high percentages of viable cells with values of 95 \u00b1 4%.\n\nAfter 24 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C without antibiotics (untreated sample T24), the cell viability was 97 \u00b1 3%.\n\nThe percentage decrease (Table 1) of the viable cells was used to monitor the effect of antibiotics.\n\nThe results evidenced significant differences (P < 0.01) in cell viability (after 24 h at 37\u00b0C) in the samples containing antibiotics compared to the antibiotic-free samples.Table 1.\n\nPercentage Decrease in the Number of Viable Cells for each E.\n\ncoli Strain After Treatment with the Antibiotics Respect to the

E.\n\ncoli strains isolated from the riverine water were generally more resistant than ATCC 25922, regardless of the antibiotic used (P < 0.001).\n\nEven if the antibiotics showed a different degree of efficacy in the reduction of cell viability, the number of viable cells never dropped below 3.84 \u00d7 105 cell/ml.\n\nStrains 7 and 9 were the most sensitive, while strain 3 maintained the highest number of viable cells (P < 0.001), followed by strains 1, 4, 2, 6, 5, 10, and 8.Ampicillin and the mix were more efficient in affecting cell viability with respect to the untreated sample.\n\nStrain 3 showed high cell viability after treatment with ampicillin, streptomycin and penicillin, and kanamycin; strains 1, 2, and 4 showed high cell viability after treatment with kanamycin and nalidixic acid; strains 5, 6, and 10 showed high cell viability only after treatment with kanamycin, while for strain 8 this was the case with nalidixic acid (Table 1).\n\nThe high reductions in the number of viable cells (see Supporting Information, Table 1) after exposure to chloramphenicol are not surprising.\n\nIn fact, even if chloramphenicol is defined as bacteriostatic, it is known that an antibiotic may behave as a bacteriostatic or bactericidal agent depending on several factors, including the dose and the bacterial strain [26].The analysis of membrane potential was based on the use of DiOC2: the fluorescence of cells exposed to this dye increases with hyperpolarization and decreases with depolarization.\n\nEach fluorescence value (FV) was compared to the untreated sample FVs, revealing the membrane integrity.\n\nIt was possible to distinguish two bacterial populations with FVs that differed by one or two logs: one with median FVs ranging between 350 and 575 (M2, indicative of membrane integrity), and one with values ranging between 150 and 350 (M1, indicative of membrane damage.\n\nSee Supporting Information, Tables 2 and 3).\n\nThe subpopulation with the greatest decrease in membrane potential gave rise to the concomitant increase of the other subpopulation (Fig.\n\n1b).\n\nWhen the strains showed a strong decrease in cell viability, the subpopulation with low FVs was predominant, and this is coherent with the well known fact that agents that damage the cytoplasmic membrane may also cause changes to the magnitude of the membrane potential.\n\nTherefore, as previously demonstrated [12], DiOC2 may be a valid fluorochrome for detecting changes in the membrane potential with regard to viability.The shifts in FSC and SSC observed in all of the strains after 24 h of incubation with or without antibiotic may represent the bacterial population moving into the log phase of growth.\n\nIndividual events could represent larger individual organisms, some of which may be undergoing separation and division.\n\nThe presence of profound changes in the FSC and SSC of the bacterial populations as a consequence of antibiotic exposure is noteworthy (see Supporting Information, Tables 4 and 5).\n\nFurthermore, the results concerning the changes in the scatter signals confirmed the viability data.\n\nIndeed, when high viability after treatment was registered, the scatter signals did not change or induced very minor changes in the profile of the remaining bacterial population.\n\nFor all of the E.\n\ncoli strains, significant changes (P < 0.01) were observed in the presence of ampicillin and the antibiotic mix compared to the untreated sample.\n\nIn particular, they induced a decrease in both the SSC and FSC mean values.The results evidenced an increase in FSC values after nalidixic acid and cloramphenicol treatments.\n\nAt the same time, there was a significant increase (P < 0.01) in SSC after incubation with kanamycin, gentamicin, streptomycin, and nalidix acid.\n\nThe cloramphenicol treatment did not register any significant changes in SSC.\n\nGant et al.\n\n[8] demonstrated profound changes in the FSC coordinates of a bacterial population that reflect the modes of action of antibiotics.\n\nSimilar to our results, even if at lower concentrations, they also found that gentamicin induced minor changes in the profile of the FSC, while the changes induced by ampicillin were greater.\n\nThese changes to the FSC can be explained by the fact that these antibiotics directly or indirectly affect the cell wall.CONCLUSIONSTop of pageAbstractMETHODSRESULTS AND DISCUSSIONCONCLUSIONSACKNOWLEDGMENTSLITERATURE CITEDSupporting InformationThe development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria is mainly due to the widespread use of antibiotics in human and animal practice, and to their persistence in the aquatic environment and soil.\n\nIn this study, PCR identified a single resistance gene in one E.\n\ncoli strain isolated from river, confirming the presence of antibiotic-resistance phenomena in this human-modified environment.\n\nFurthermore, analyses of cell viability using FCM evidenced the presence of viable subpopulations after antibiotic treatment, even if resistance genes were not detected by PCR.\n\nAs a consequence of antibiotic exposure, the E.\n\ncoli cells underwent profound changes in FSC and SSC, which is coherent with the viability and DiOC2 data.Accordingly, this flow cytometric multiparametric approach proved to be a useful method for evaluating E.\n\ncoli responses after antibiotic exposure, providing results about different aspects (membrane potential, light scatter changes) with statistical power and in a short period of time.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSTop of
